For EACH chunk, decide whether it deserves an image (0 or 1 per chunk). This ensures images are distributed throughout the narrative.\n\nFor each image, choose one type:\n\n1. **Entity Reference** (type: \"entity_ref\") - Use when a specific entity is prominently featured\n   - Best for: Introductions, key moments focused on a single entity\n\n2. **Scene Prompt** (type: \"prompt_request\") - Use for scenes involving multiple entities or environments\n   - Best for: Multi-entity scenes, locations, action moments, atmospheric shots\n   - REQUIRED: Include involvedEntityIds with at least one entity that appears in the scene\n\n## Output Format\nReturn a JSON object. For each image placement, provide an entry with anchorText from the relevant chunk:\n{\n  \"imageRefs\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"entity_ref\",\n      \"entityId\": \"<entity id from list above>\",\n      \"anchorText\": \"<exact 5-15 word phrase from the chronicle>\",\n      \"size\": \"small|medium|large|full-width\",\n      \"caption\": \"<optional>\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"prompt_request\",\n      \"sceneDescription\": \"<vivid 1-2 sentence scene description>\",\n      \"involvedEntityIds\": [\"<entity-id-1>\", \"<entity-id-2>\"],\n      \"anchorText\": \"<exact 5-15 word phrase from the chronicle>\",\n      \"size\": \"small|medium|large|full-width\",\n      \"caption\": \"<optional>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n## Size Guidelines\n- small: 150px, supplementary/margin images\n- medium: 300px, standard single-entity images\n- large: 450px, key scenes\n- full-width: 100%, establishing shots\n\n## Rules\n- Suggest 0 or 1 image per chunk (total 2-5 images for the whole chronicle)\n- anchorText MUST be an exact phrase from that chunk's text\n- entityId and involvedEntityIds MUST use IDs from the Available Entities list\n- For prompt_request, involvedEntityIds MUST contain at least one entity ID\n- Return valid JSON only, no markdown\n\n## Chronicle Chunks\n### CHUNK 1 of 4\nThe ice in the upper tunnels holds a particular blue—not sky-color, nothing that simple, but the shade of water before it decides to freeze. Kaela has been staring at a pressure-seam for longer than her lamp-oil should allow. Her flippers rest against the wall, feeling for the tremor that will tell her if this vein is ready to carve or if it needs another season of settling. Her flippers haven't stopped shaking since that night. Three months; doesn't matter.\n\nShe used to read ice the way other penguins read faces. Could tell you where a fissure would run before the first pick struck. Could seal a tunnel against collapse with three careful cuts and a prayer to nothing in particular. Master carver, they'd called her. Past tense now, though no one says it to her flippers.\n\nThe younger miners think she's cautious. Wise. They don't know she can't feel the ice anymore—not the way she used to. The crystal used to sing its intentions; now it just sits there, blue and silent and full of something she doesn't have words for.\n\n*The ice remembers.* Old saying. She used to think it was poetry.\n\n---\n\nThat night the aurora didn't reach down. Kaela remembers because she'd checked—three times, the paranoid checking of someone who knows the dark has teeth. The Bastion Apex had been scrubbed for months. She'd been part of the crew. They'd washed away old blood, silenced the pressure-echoes through work that left her flippers raw and her back aching in that good way, the way that means something's been *done*.\n\nThe Communion came in ash-gray robes with hems that glowed. Ember-thread, someone whispered. Costs more than a season's\n---\n\n### CHUNK 2 of 4\nfire-core ration.\n\nThey carved symbols that hurt to look at. Not because they were ugly—because they were too *right*, like someone had found the exact shape of a scream and frozen it into the ice. ☽'glacial Crystalline~ Spiral: the art of sealing moments into water, making the ice remember so perfectly that it bleeds back into you. Recursion. The same heartbeat trapped in tighter and tighter rings.\n\nShe hadn't known what they were doing. Not really. Just that fire-cores were involved, used wrong, used to *open* instead of forge or transform or destroy.\n\nThe dark energy didn't sound like anything. It felt like drowning while standing.\n\nAfterward: copper. Burnt bone-marrow. And beneath the ice, something that moved that wasn't orca, wasn't anything with a name she wanted to speak.\n\nShe descended twice more after that night. The third time, her flippers wouldn't grip the rope. Just—wouldn't. She stood at the edge of the third ice-shelf and understood that her body had made a decision her mind was still arguing against.\n\nMaster carver. Past tense.\n\n---\n\n\"Kaela-elder, your lamp.\"\n\nThe voice pulls her back. Young Aetereth~, barely past his first molt, holding out a fresh core. She's been standing here long enough that her own light guttered to almost nothing. Stupid. Dangerous. The kind of mistake that kills penguins in the deep tunnels.\n\nExcept she doesn't go to the deep tunnels anymore.\n\n\"Your oil's wrong,\" she says, taking the core but checking his lamp instead. Her flippers shake as she adjusts the wick. \"Burns too fast. You'll be dark before you reach the second shelf.\"\n\n\"I mixed it myself.\" Pride in his\n---\n\n### CHUNK 3 of 4\nvoice, the kind that hasn't learned to hide yet.\n\n\"You mixed it wrong.\" She hands it back. \"Add more seal-fat. Less aurora-distillate. The Stack-dwellers sell you pretty light that doesn't last.\"\n\nHe nods, eager. Wants to ask something. She can see it in the way his flippers tap against his sides—the nervous rhythm of someone who's heard stories.\n\n\"You were there,\" he says finally. \"At the Apex. When the Communion—\"\n\n\"I check lamp-oil now.\" Flat. Final. The way you close a door.\n\n\"But you were a master carver. You could teach—\"\n\n\"I *do* teach.\" She reaches out, stills his tapping flippers with her own shaking ones. \"I'm teaching you right now. Listen: the ice doesn't forgive mistakes. Not down there. Your lamp-oil burns right or you don't come back. That's the lesson.\"\n\nHe stares at her flippers. At the tremor she can't control.\n\n\"What did you see?\" Whisper-quiet. \"In the water. After.\"\n\nThe smell of copper floods her beak. Burnt bone-marrow. The way the ice itself seemed to *weep*.\n\n\"I saw that I wasn't a master of anything,\" she says. \"Go fix your lamp-oil, Aetereth~. Before you kill yourself trying to prove something to someone who doesn't care.\"\n\nHe leaves. She's alone again with the blue ice and its particular silence.\n\n---\n\nThe pressure-seam still needs reading. Kaela leans close, brings her beak almost to the frozen surface, breathes fog against it the way she used to when reading the deep crystal. The condensation spreads in fractal patterns.\n\nFor a moment—just a moment—she sees it: the spiral. The recursion. The same instant trapped in tighter and tighter rings. Her flipper against ice on a night\n---\n\n### CHUNK 4 of 4\nwhen the aurora didn't reach. The Communion's symbols that hurt to look at. The dark energy that felt like drowning. The thing beneath the ice that moved without a name.\n\nAll of it, sealed. All of it, bleeding back.\n\n*The ice remembers.*\n\nShe pulls away. The fractal fog evaporates. The seam is just a seam—pressure-stressed, ready to carve in maybe two seasons if someone who isn't her does the work.\n\nHer flippers shake. They haven't stopped. They won't.\n\nMaster carver. Past tense. But she can still read lamp-oil. Can still teach the young ones how to burn their light so it lasts. Can still work the upper tunnels where the ice is new enough that it hasn't learned to remember.\n\nDown below, past the third shelf, past the places her body won't let her go—down there, the Bastion Apex still holds those moments. The ritual. The opening. The thing without a name. Crystalline spiral sealed into ice that remembers too perfectly.\n\nShe doesn't need to descend to know it's there.\n\nSome nights she wakes up drowning while standing.\n\nSome nights she's grateful her flippers won't grip the rope.\n\nThe blue ice watches. Holds its particular shade—not sky-color, nothing that simple, but the color of water before it decides to freeze. Before it decides what to remember. Before the moment seals and recurses and bleeds back into everything it touches.\n\nKaela picks up her lamp. Checks the oil. It burns steady, warm, enough to last until she reaches the surface where the aurora still touches and the ice is young enough to forget.\n\nShe doesn't look at the pressure-seam again.\n\nShe already knows what it would tell her.\n---"}]}
