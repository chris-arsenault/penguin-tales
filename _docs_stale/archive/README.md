## Why Archive?

These documents provide:
- **Context** for current system design decisions
- **History** of what was tried and what worked
- **Reference** for similar future work

They are **not actively maintained** but are kept for historical reference.

## What to Archive

Move documents here when:
- Implementation is complete and tested
- Proposal has been implemented (move to `/proposals/`)
- Session/test is finished (move to `/sessions/`)
- Document is >2 weeks old and no longer actively referenced

## What NOT to Archive

Keep in main docs if:
- Still being actively developed
- Referenced frequently
- Serves as ongoing reference guide
- Represents planned/future work
