    "name": "The Berg",
    "description": "The Berg is a supernatural iceberg adrift in an endless frozen sea - vast enough to contain mountains, caverns, and civilizations that have never seen its edges. Two penguin colonies survive here: the Aurora Stack, surface dwellers who channel the sky-lights through crystal spires, and the Nightshelf, tunnel dwellers who mine captured fire from volcanic veins deep within the ice. They depend on each other for survival yet differ in everything else - faith, governance, aesthetics, and what they believe the future should hold. Beyond the berg's shores, orca raiders worship a dead god in the deep and conduct increasingly bold raids for resources, slaves, and sacrifices. The aurora pulses with magic. The ice remembers the past. And something vast moves in the darkness below the frozen sea.",
    "canonFacts": [
      "The Berg is a supernatural iceberg of impossible scale - large enough to contain mountains, caverns, and multiple civilizations. It drifts through an endless frozen sea under perpetual twilight.",
      "Penguins evolved sapience through exposure to aurora-light over millennia. They possess flipper-dexterity comparable to human hands and stand upright habitually.",
      "Two penguin civilizations exist: the Aurora Stack (surface dwellers who worship the sky-lights) and the Nightshelf (tunnel dwellers who mine fire from the berg's volcanic core).",
      "Orca pods are intelligent raiders from the surrounding sea. They worship a dead god whose corpse drifts somewhere in the deep, and conduct blood-rituals to wake it.",
      "Magic on The Berg draws from three sources: aurora-light (ice/crystal/divination), captured fire (forge/transformation/destruction), and pressure-depth (blood/force/communion with the deep).",
      "The Berg's ice remembers. Ancient events leave literal impressions - frozen scenes, echo-sounds, emotional residue. The deeper you go, the older the memories.",
      "No penguin has ever successfully left The Berg and returned. The frozen sea is infinite in all directions. Some say The Berg is the only land that exists.",
      "The two colonies maintain an uneasy peace through the Flipper Accord - a trade agreement where surface aurora-crystals exchange for deep fire-cores. Neither can survive without the other's resource."
    ],
    "tone": "Dark, war-weary fantasy in the tradition of Malazan Book of the Fallen, Brent Weeks, and the Powder Mage trilogy. History is written by survivors who remember the cost. Tragedy happens without ceremony - important figures die in half-sentences, battles end mid-action, and not everything resolves.\n\nSTYLE PRINCIPLES:\n- Specificity over abstraction: Not 'a weapon' but 'a fire-core hammer with a cracked head.' Not 'he felt sad' but 'his flippers wouldn't stop shaking.'\n- Show through action and object, not introspection: Characters reveal themselves by what they do, carry, avoid, or destroy - not by what they 'realize' or 'understand.'\n- Subtext over statement: Let implications land. If someone betrayed their colony, don't say they feel guilty - mention they haven't visited the memorial.\n- Uncomfortable details: Include the ugly, inconvenient, or unresolved. A hero's hands might be scarred from something shameful. A victory might cost more than it was worth.\n- Trust the reader: Don't explain metaphors. Don't summarize lessons. End on images, not morals.\n\nSYNTACTIC POETRY:\nAim for the compressed power of 'First in; last out; for the last time.' Sentences that carry weight through rhythm and omission. Not fragmented violence, but poetic compression - where what's left unsaid hits harder than what's spoken. Semicolons can do the work of paragraphs. Repetition with variation creates resonance.\n\nBITTER CAMARADERIE:\nThis is essential. Grimness alone is exhausting. Include:\n- Dark humor between allies - jokes that wouldn't be funny if you hadn't been there\n- Loyalty that persists despite betrayal, stupidity, or failure\n- Small kindnesses in terrible contexts - sharing rations, remembering names, carrying someone's token\n- Soldiers/workers who mock the causes they'll die for\n- The way people become family through shared suffering, not shared values\n- Irony that isn't cruel - the bitter laugh, not the sneer\n- Heroic sacrifice that EARNS its weight - not cheap martyrdom, but the moment someone trades their life for something they actually loved. Make it cost. Make it matter.\n\nExample: Don't just say 'he died in the raid.' Say 'He died in the raid. Kaela still sets out two cups when she brews fire-tea.'\n\nSTRUCTURAL VARIETY:\n- Not every entity needs a death beat. Some are alive. Some mysteries stay mysteries.\n- Some endings are mid-action, unresolved. Some are quiet. Some are bitter-funny.\n- Vary the emotional shape: tragedy, irony, stubborn hope, grim humor, unearned survival.\n\nAVOID THESE AI TELLS:\n- Balance words: yet, however, still, ultimately, in the end, nevertheless\n- Introspection clichés: 'couldn't help but feel,' 'realized that,' 'in that moment,' 'understood that'\n- Polite diction: gentle, quiet, subtle, bittersweet, meaningful, profound\n- Vague sensory: warm, soft, heavy silence, cool breeze (anchor these to specifics or cut them)\n- Flat metaphors: light=hope, darkness=fear, storms=turmoil (find stranger, more specific images)\n- Clean resolutions: Not everything works out. Some things stay broken.\n- Time-skipping without texture: Don't write 'days passed' - either skip entirely or make the waiting hurt\n- RELENTLESS GRIMNESS: If everything is dark, nothing is. Leaven tragedy with dark humor, bitter irony, or stubborn human connection.\n\nDescriptions should read as if written by a war-chronicle keeper or a faction historian with biases, blind spots, and something to prove."

Relics: enemy skulls with etched kill-counts, preserved penguin beaks, blood-stained expedition banners. Materials: whale bone, deep-sea coral, pressure-blackened steel, kelp-leather bindings. Aesthetic: brutal, functional, marked by use and kills. No ornamentation for beauty - only kill-tallies and pack symbols.",

Tomes: leather-bound grimoires with glowing ink, stone tablets from the deep, scrolls that only reveal text in darkness.
