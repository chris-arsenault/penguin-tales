# The Berg

Aurora Berg is a continent of ice at the bottom of the world - a place where the aurora dances above towering glaciers, where shadows pool in crevasses that have never seen light, and where the boundary between the living and the remembered grows thin in The Long Dark.

## Geography

Aurora Berg is not a single landmass but a complex arrangement of ice shelves, volcanic archipelagos, and the great central plateau known as **The Stack**.

### Aurora Stack

The highest reaches of Aurora Berg, where permanent settlements cling to volcanic vents that provide warmth against the endless cold. Here the aurora is visible even during the brief summer, painting the ice in greens and purples. Aurora Stack rises in tiers - each level a different microclimate, each hosting its own communities.

- **The Upper Reaches** - Closest to the sky, where ice-seers read fortunes in the aurora's dance
- **The Trade Terraces** - The great markets where goods flow between all cultures, dominated by The Icebound Exchange
- **The Huddle Warrens** - Dense residential areas where warmth is shared
- **The Foundation Depths** - Ancient tunnels carved by volcanic heat

### Nightfall Shelf

Beneath the permanent ice shelf, where sunlight never penetrates. Nightfall Shelf exists in perpetual twilight, lit only by bioluminescent creatures and the faint glow of volcanic vents. Here, shadow is not merely absence of light - it is a substance, a medium through which power flows.

- **The Shroud Depths** - Where the shelf meets the sea
- **The Whisper Galleries** - Acoustic chambers that carry secrets
- **The Void Markets** - Where forbidden things change hands, controlled by The Midnight Claws
- **The Glow-Fissure** - A deep crack pulsing with cold blue-green light, its depths forbidden

### The Orca Territories

The open waters surrounding Aurora Berg, where the apex predators rule. Orcas do not build - they claim. Their territories are defined by hunting grounds, marked by the bones of their kills.

- **The Hunting Currents** - Migration routes of prey
- **The Corpse Current** - Where the dead god's blood still circulates, sacred to The Wake-Singers
- **The Deep Trenches** - Where elder orcas descend to die
- **The Killing Shallows** - Ambush zones near penguin colonies

## The Seasons

The Berg knows only two true seasons: **The Endless Day** and **The Long Dark**.

### The Endless Day (Summer)

For four months, the sun never sets. The ice retreats, the seas teem with krill, and the penguins gorge themselves in preparation for what comes. This is the time of plenty - of festivals, of mating, of forgetting the horrors of winter.

But the Endless Day is not without danger. The melting ice reveals things that should stay buried. Ancient artifacts surface. Crevasses open without warning. And the orcas grow bold, pressing ever closer to the shore.

### The Long Dark (Winter)

For four months, the sun never rises. Temperatures plunge to unsurvivable levels. The sea freezes solid for miles from shore. The penguins huddle in their warrens, surviving on stored fat and the warmth of each other.

In the Long Dark, the boundary between the living world and the ice-memory grows thin. The ancestors speak more clearly. Visions come unbidden. Some penguins walk out onto the ice and never return - whether taken by cold, by predators, or by something else entirely, none can say.

### The Transitions

The times between - **The Thaw** and **The Freeze** - are the most dangerous of all. The ice is unstable. The weather unpredictable. Orcas hunt most aggressively during the Thaw, knowing their window is closing.

## The Three Peoples

The Berg is home to three sapient cultures, each adapted to their environment in ways that go beyond the physical.

### The Aurora Penguins

Dwellers of the high ice, the Aurora penguins are the most numerous and the most organized. They believe the ice remembers all things, and that identity is not fixed but accumulated - a penguin is the sum of what the ice has witnessed them become.

They are traders, diplomats, builders. Their society is hierarchical but fluid - prominence can be earned, and echoes can be added to any name through great deeds.

### The Nightshelf Penguins  

Those who dwell beneath, in the eternal twilight. The Nightshelf penguins have adapted to darkness in ways that unsettle their surface cousins. They see by echolocation and bioluminescence. They believe that names hold power, and so they never speak them fully.

They are mystics, assassins, keepers of forbidden knowledge. Their society is built on secrets - what you know determines what you are.

### The Orca

The apex predators of The Berg's waters. Orcas are not evil - they are simply what they are. They hunt penguins because penguins are prey. They respect strength and despise weakness. Their culture is one of pure meritocracy - you are your kills, nothing more.

Some orcas have learned to communicate with penguins. Some even trade. But no penguin ever forgets that an orca's friendship is conditional, and that condition is: *be more useful alive than dead*.

## The Ice Remembers

The most fundamental truth of The Berg: the ice is not merely frozen water. It is a medium of memory. Events leave impressions. The dead leave echoes. Time itself flows differently here, pooling in some places, rushing in others. See The Ice Remembers for a deeper exploration of this phenomenon.

This is why penguin names carry parenthetical echoes - the ice annotates existence. This is why the Nightshelf fear complete names - to name something fully is to give the ice power over it. This is why orcas define themselves by deeds - in the water, there is no ice to remember, so they must carry their own history in their names. See The Languages of The Berg for how each culture's naming conventions reflect these beliefs.

The Berg is not just a place. It is a memory palace the size of a continent, and everything that happens here is recorded forever in the frost.
