# The Orca

*"We do not have names. We have histories. We do not have homes. We have hunting grounds. We do not have friends. We have... useful prey."*

The orca are the apex predators of Aurora Berg's waters. They are not monsters - they are simply what evolution made them: perfect killing machines with intelligence enough to know exactly what they are. They hunt penguins because penguins are prey. They trade with penguins because sometimes cooperation is more efficient than consumption. There is no malice in this. There is no mercy either.

## Core Beliefs

### You Are Your Kills

Orca identity is constructed entirely from deeds. A young orca has a simple name: their first kill-type and method. As they hunt, their name grows. An elder orca's name might be dozens of syllables long - a complete record of everything they have ever killed.

This is not boasting. This is *identity*. An orca literally cannot introduce themselves without reciting their history. To lie about your kills is not merely shameful - it is to claim an identity you do not possess, a form of existential theft.

### The Hunt is Sacred

Hunting is not merely survival to the orca. It is the fundamental activity of existence. Everything else - mating, communication, travel - exists to enable more hunting. An orca who cannot hunt is not a failed orca; they are simply not an orca at all.

This is why orca respect hunters of all species. A penguin who has killed - even if they killed in defense - has more status in orca eyes than a penguin who has never taken life. The orca understand that the world is divided into predators and prey, and they respect anything that has proven itself a predator.

### Strength Deserves Survival

Orca have no concept of mercy in the penguin sense. They do not spare the weak out of compassion. But they do practice a form of... selection. A prey animal that fights back, that demonstrates unexpected strength or cunning, may be allowed to escape. Not out of kindness, but out of *investment* - strong prey breeds stronger prey, and stronger prey is more satisfying to hunt.

## Society

### The Pod

Orca organize into pods - extended family groups that hunt together. A pod typically contains 5-30 individuals, led by the eldest female (the one with the longest name).

Pod membership is nearly absolute. Orca will die for their pod without hesitation. But pod membership can change - an orca who consistently fails to contribute may be... asked to leave. This is usually fatal, as lone orca cannot hunt effectively.

### The Name-Hierarchy

Within a pod, status is determined entirely by name-length. The longest name leads. This creates a natural gerontocracy - elders have simply had more time to accumulate kills - but it can be disrupted by exceptional hunters who rack up kills quickly.

Name-challenges are possible: if an orca believes their kills have been undercounted or another's overcounted, they can demand a formal recitation. The pod judges. Dishonesty is punishable by exile.

### Pod-Roles

Within the hunt, orca take on specialized roles:

- **Vor** (First-strikers) - The fastest, who initiate attacks
- **Grrul** (Herders) - Who drive prey toward the killers
- **Thrak** (Finishers) - Who deliver killing blows
- **Zund** (Watchers) - Who track prey and coordinate

A complete hunt requires all roles. An orca's pod-role is part of their identity, appearing in their name.

## Practices

### The Hunt-Singing

Orca communicate through complex vocalizations that serve multiple purposes: echolocation, coordination, intimidation. The "hunt-song" that precedes an attack is both tactical communication and psychological warfare - prey who hear it know death is coming.

Different pods have distinct songs. This allows coordination between allied pods and identification of rivals.

### The Blood-Warm Gatherings

At volcanic vents (blood-warms), orca from different pods gather to socialize, mate, and exchange information. These gatherings are neutral ground - violence is forbidden, though dominance displays are expected.

At blood-warms, pods negotiate hunting territories, arrange matings, and occasionally trade intelligence about prey movements. A pod with information about a rich hunting ground can trade that knowledge for mating rights or territorial concessions.

### The Deep Descent

When an orca grows too old to hunt effectively, they make the Deep Descent - a solo dive into the abyssal trenches from which they do not return. This is not seen as tragedy but as completion. An orca who can no longer hunt has finished their story; the Deep Descent is simply the final punctuation.

Some orca return from failed descents. These "twice-born" are regarded with awe and fear - they have seen the deep and been rejected by it. They often become shamans, interpreters of whatever they witnessed in the abyss. Grandmother Deep is the most revered of these - an ancient matriarch who dove to touch the dead god's body and returned... changed.

### The Wake-Singers

A cult of orca shamans who gather at The Corpse Current - where the dead god's blood still circulates - to conduct rituals of blood sacrifice. The Wake-Singers believe accumulated kills can wake the sleeping deity beneath the frozen sea. They wield The Dreaming Tooth, a relic carved from the dead god's jaw, which grants power over pressure-magic and communion with things in the deep. Grandmother Deep guides their theology.

### Penguin-Trading

Some pods have developed sophisticated trading relationships with penguin colonies. This is purely practical - a penguin who provides valuable information or goods is more useful alive than eaten. But every penguin who trades with orca knows the relationship could end at any moment.

The most successful penguin traders learn to make themselves *continuously* useful. The moment they stop providing value, they become prey again.

## Relations with Other Cultures

### With Aurora Stack

The orca find Aurora Stack culture baffling. All that ceremony, all those witnessed deeds, all that concern with how others perceive you - why? Either you can kill or you cannot. Either you are useful or you are food. The ice does not "remember" anything; it simply freezes.

But Aurora penguins are numerous, organized, and sometimes willing to trade. So the orca tolerate them, protect certain colonies in exchange for goods, and only hunt the unprotected.

### With Nightshelf

The orca respect the Nightshelf more. Shadow-dwellers understand concealment, ambush, the value of not being seen until it's too late. Some orca have developed genuine working relationships with Nightshelf brokers - exchanges of information that benefit both parties.

The Nightshelf are still prey, of course. But they are prey that understands the game.

## The Orca Ideal

The perfect orca is a name so long it takes minutes to recite - a lifetime of kills, a complete history of predation. They lead their pod through strength and wisdom. They die in the deep when their time comes, adding a final chapter to a story written in blood.

This is the orca dream: to hunt until you can hunt no more, and then to end on your own terms. The penguins want to be remembered; the orca want to be *complete*.
