# The Before Times

*"The ice remembers everything. Even the things that came before memory."*

Buried in the deepest ice, frozen for epochs beyond counting, lie artifacts that should not exist. Objects of impossible materials, inscribed with serial numbers in no known language, radiating power that makes the ice-memory itself recoil. The penguins call them relics of The Before Times - though whether they come from ancient history or somewhere else entirely, no one knows.

## The Apocalypse Canon

Scholars have catalogued six known artifacts from The Before Times. Each bears an alphanumeric designation - not a name, but a serial number, as if they were manufactured rather than crafted. Each holds power sufficient to reshape The Berg itself.

### Known Artifacts

**8H-H1Y0B (Prime Shard)**
A fragment of something larger, its edges impossibly sharp, its surface shifting between states of matter. Currently held in Aurora Stack's deepest vaults. Ice-readers who approach it report hearing numbers - endless strings of numbers - in a voice that sounds like grinding glaciers.

**9V-X3DV1L8 (Extinction Node)**
A sphere of absolute darkness that absorbs all light. Held by the Nightshelf, who claim it speaks to them in the shadow-tongue. Some believe it is not an artifact at all, but a hole in reality - a place where something was removed.

**T5-W5WJ3P (Ultima Core)**
Recovered from the belly of a dead leviathan by orca divers. It pulses with heat that never diminishes. The Wake-Singers use it in their rituals, believing it contains the heartbeat of the dead god. They may not be entirely wrong.

**H8-5KB7Z4 (Omega Hammer)**
A tool of some kind - or a weapon. When struck against ice, it does not break the ice; it *unmakes* it, as if the ice had never existed. The Aurora keep it sealed, terrified of what it might unmake if misused.

**P3-8NL2B5H (Singularity Obelisk)**
A pillar that stands in defiance of gravity, floating precisely three inches above whatever surface it is placed on. Its surface is covered in the serial numbers of other artifacts - a manifest, perhaps, of things yet to be found.

**8R-W6GQ3K3L (Singularity Beam)**
A rod that emits light of a color that has no name. Those who look upon it see different things - some see the future, some see the past, some see nothing at all and are never quite the same afterward.

## Origins Unknown

Where do these artifacts come from? Theories abound:

**The Deep Ice Hypothesis**
The artifacts are remnants of beings who lived on The Berg millions of years ago - a civilization so ancient that even the ice-memory has compressed their impressions into incomprehensible noise. The serial numbers are their language, untranslatable because no context remains.

**The Fallen Sky Theory**
The artifacts fell from beyond the sky - gifts or debris from entities that exist in the spaces between stars. This would explain why they follow no natural laws and why the ice-memory cannot properly record them. They are simply *foreign* to this reality.

**The Future Echo Speculation**
Some ice-readers, accessing the deepest impressions, have reported seeing not the past but what feels like the future - ruined cities, lights in the sky, the ice itself burning. Perhaps the artifacts are echoes traveling backward through time, remnants of something that hasn't happened yet.

**The Dead God's Tools**
The Wake-Singers believe all the artifacts are pieces of the dead god - the vast being whose corpse lies frozen beneath The Corpse Current. The serial numbers are the god's true names, and assembling all the artifacts would wake it. This is either their greatest hope or The Berg's greatest danger, depending on who you ask.

## The Naming Problem

The artifacts resist proper naming. Aurora penguins cannot add echoes to them - the ice refuses to annotate what it cannot comprehend. Nightshelf penguins cannot truncate designations that are already incomplete. Orca cannot claim kills they did not make.

So the serial numbers persist. 8H-H1Y0B. 9V-X3DV1L8. Cold, meaningless strings that nonetheless carry weight - the weight of something that existed before meaning existed.

Some scholars have tried to assign proper names. "Prime Shard" for 8H-H1Y0B. "Extinction Node" for 9V-X3DV1L8. These names stick in casual conversation, but the artifacts themselves seem to reject them. Documents that use the common names have a way of being lost. Penguins who speak the common names too often begin dreaming of numbers.

The serial numbers are not names. They are *designations*. And whatever designated them has not forgotten.

## Handling Protocols

Each culture has developed protocols for handling Before Times artifacts:

**Aurora:** Store in the deepest vaults, surrounded by ice-readers who monitor for changes. Never touch directly. Document everything, even when documentation seems to alter itself.

**Nightshelf:** Keep in absolute darkness. Assign watchers who are already Exposed - those with no secrets left to lose. Trade information about the artifacts, but never the artifacts themselves.

**Orca:** The Wake-Singers claim custody of any artifact found in the waters. They believe the artifacts are sacred. Other pods disagree. This has led to violence.

## The Fear

The deepest fear about The Before Times artifacts is simple: they are not random relics. They are numbered. Serial numbers imply a series. A series implies a count.

Six have been found. How many more exist? What happens when they are all assembled? And most terrifying of all - who or what is keeping count?

The ice remembers everything. But the ice-memory was not always here. Something came before. And something left these artifacts behind.

Whether as tools, as warnings, or as the first moves in a game that spans epochs - no one knows. But the artifacts wait in their vaults and their temples, patient as glaciers, their serial numbers gleaming in the dark.

Waiting to be found. Waiting to be understood. Waiting, perhaps, to be used.

The Before Times are not entirely gone. They left these pieces of themselves behind. And pieces have a way of wanting to become whole again.
