yes, but make the updates to rites and succession you p# The Languages of The Berg

Aurora Berg's three cultures don't just speak differently - they *think* about identity differently. This shapes how they name everything: people, places, factions, and artifacts. For cultural context, see Aurora Stack, Nightshelf, and Orca.

## Core Premise: "The Ice Remembers"

Penguins don't experience time linearly. The ice holds memory - events echo forward and backward. This fundamentally shapes how they name things:

- **Names are not labels, they are echoes** - a name carries what the ice remembers about the thing
- **Identity is layered** - who you are now, who you were, who the ice says you'll become
- **Sound matters differently** - penguin hearing evolved for ice acoustics, not air

---

## Aurora Stack: The Parenthetical Echo System

### Concept: Names Have Memory-Annotations

Aurora penguins acknowledge that the ice annotates everything. When the ice "remembers" something about you, that memory becomes part of your name. These **parenthetical echoes** are not optional flourishes - they're the ice's witness to your existence.

### Grammar Patterns

**Simple Echo** - `Name (ice-memory)`
```
High-Beak Auditor Selka    -- the current Aurora Stack mayor
Piien (twice-hatched)      -- survived something, reborn
Losek (trade-blessed)      -- the ice saw prosperity follow them
Valmori (echo: Valum)      -- carries an ancestor's echo
```

**Clan-Echo Chain** - `Name (echo) clan'Place`
```
Voraesueina (frost-written) kria'Spire
Peiaeesi (light-descended) rukar'Reach
Teime (ice-spoken) molok'Depths
```
The clan marker (`kria'`, `rukar'`) indicates lineage. The place indicates origin-territory.

**Layered Echoes** - for important figures, the ice remembers MORE
```
Skailaen (twice-blessed, light-bearer, echo: Skai)
Nalreniro (frost-bane, void-touched, echo: Nalren, echo: Nal)
```
More echoes = more history = more significance.

### Sound Profile
- Chinese-influenced phonetics: zh, sh, ch, x, q, j (no consonant clusters)
- Vowels and finals: a, o, e, i, u, ai, ei, ou, ong, ang, ing
- Common roots: Xue-, Zhi-, Lian-, Feng-, Ming-, Qing-
- Endings: -long, -hua, -wei, -lin, -jun
- The parenthetical content uses more English sounds - the ice "translating" for us

## Nightshelf: The Incomplete Name System

### Concept: Full Names Hold Power (So Never Speak Them)

In shadow, names are dangerous. To know something's full name is to have power over it. Nightshelf penguins therefore:

- Never speak complete names
- Leave beginnings OR endings unvoiced
- Use fragments that imply wholeness
- Mark truncations with the crescent moon (☽) - symbol of incomplete cycles

### Grammar Patterns

**Moon-Prefix** - `☽'name` (beginning consumed by shadow)
```
☽'varius                   -- what came before is swallowed
☽'ent' Vigil               -- truncated fragment + title
☽'shadow Xarem~            -- prefix + trailing whisper
```

**Moon-Suffix** - `name☽` (ending fades into darkness)
```
Umbra☽                     -- the shadow continues unspeaking
Night☽ Silvsomiae          -- faded ending + full name
Moth☽ Shimmer              -- mid-name truncation
```

**Internal Truncation** - `name∴name` (syllables swallowed mid-word)
```
Dusk∴glide                 -- the "therefore" mark for consumed syllables
Circle∴sea-bound~          -- internal + trailing whisper
Apex∴enchant               -- power-words with hidden cores
```

**Whisper-Forms** - `name~` (trails into inaudibility)
```
Reniava~                   -- fades to whisper at the end
Deal' Covenant~            -- possessive + whisper
The Shawled Scar~          -- even locations whisper
```

### Sound Profile
- Faux-Latin consonants: v, s, c, m, n, l, r, t (flowing, no hard stops)
- Vowels: a, e, i, o, u, ae, ia
- Common roots: Umbr-, Noct-, Silv-, Tene-, Luc-, Sanct-
- Endings: -us, -is, -ae, -ia, -um, -ius
- The ☽ and ∴ are *pronounced* as brief pauses or catches in the throat

## Orca: The Deed-Name System

### Concept: You ARE What You've Done

Orcas don't have names in the penguin sense. An orca's identity IS their kills, their territory, their pod-role.

### Grammar Patterns

**Kill-Names** - `[Method]-[Prey]`
```
Rend-kzul                  -- seal-render (kzul = seal in Orca)
Gnash-threk                -- whale-gnasher
Crush-pngk                 -- penguin-crusher
```

**Accumulation Names** - more kills = longer name
```
Young orca: Kzul-rend
Experienced: Kzul-threk-rend-vor
Elder: Deep-kzul-threk-pngk-rend-vor-grrul (barely pronounceable)
```

### Sound Profile (STRICT)
- Consonants: k, g, r, th, ng, z, kh, gh, rr, d, n (hard only)
- Vowels: u, i, a (short), occasional schwa
- Clusters: REQUIRED - kr, gr, th, ng, zk, khr, rnd, thng
- NO soft sounds, NO diphthongs, NO articles

## Exception: The Before Times Artifacts

Not all entities follow cultural naming conventions. Artifacts from The Before Times - ancient relics of unknown origin - bear alphanumeric serial numbers like `8H-H1Y0B` or `T5-W5WJ3P`. These are not names but *designations*, inscribed by whatever intelligence created them.

The artifacts resist proper naming. Aurora penguins cannot add echoes to them - the ice refuses to annotate what it cannot comprehend. Nightshelf penguins cannot truncate designations that are already incomplete. Orca cannot claim kills they did not make.

Common names exist (`Prime Shard`, `Extinction Node`) but the serial numbers persist in formal contexts. See The Before Times for more on these apocalyptic relics.
