# About This Project

You've stumbled into a procedurally generated world. Everything you're reading - the factions, the characters, the tangled web of alliances and betrayals - was created by algorithms. Not written by hand. Generated.

Welcome to The Berg.

## What Is This?

**Penguin Tales** is an experimental project in procedural worldbuilding. The goal: generate a fictional world with enough depth, coherence, and internal logic that it feels *authored* rather than random.

The setting is **The Berg** - a frozen continent at the bottom of the world, home to three cultures of sapient penguins (and the orcas who eat them). The cultures have distinct philosophies, naming conventions, and social structures. They trade, fight, form alliances, and occasionally get consumed by apex predators. See Aurora Stack, Nightshelf, and Orca for details on each culture.

Every entity in this wiki - every character, faction, location, artifact - was generated by a simulation. The simulation runs through "eras" of history, creating entities, forming relationships, running events, and generally making a mess of things. Then we clean up the output and present it here.

## Why Penguins?

Why not?

More seriously: penguins provide useful constraints. They're social, hierarchical, adapted to extreme environments, and have natural predators with their own complex social structures. The Antarctic setting gives us a unique aesthetic - ice, darkness, aurora, The Long Dark of polar winter - that shapes everything about how the cultures think and behave.

Also, there's something inherently a bit absurd about taking penguins this seriously. We lean into that.

## How Does It Work?

The world is generated in layers:

1. **Schema Definition** - We define what kinds of things can exist (characters, factions, locations, etc.) and how they can relate to each other

2. **Template Generation** - Templates describe *how* to create entities: what names they get, what attributes, what initial relationships

3. **Simulation** - The world runs through simulated time, with systems that create new entities, form relationships, run events, and evolve existing entities

4. **Enrichment** - Raw generated content gets enhanced with AI-generated descriptions, backstories, and details

5. **Presentation** - The final wiki you're reading now

The result is (hopefully) a world that feels coherent despite being generated. Characters have histories that make sense. Factions have plausible politics. Events have causes and consequences.

Or at least, that's the goal. Your mileage may vary. Some of the generated content is genuinely interesting; some of it is nonsense we haven't caught yet.

## The Tools

This project uses several custom tools, all of which are described in other System pages:

- **Lore Weave** - The simulation engine that generates the world
- **Name Forge** - The naming system that gives everything culture-appropriate names
- **Illuminator** - The AI enrichment layer that adds depth to raw generated content
- **Chronicler** - The wiki viewer you're using right now

They're all part of the same codebase, built to work together.

## A Note on Tone

The Berg is not a happy place. Penguins die. Predators hunt. The Long Dark claims the weak and sometimes the strong. Political factions scheme and betray. The Ice Remembers everything, which means nothing is ever truly forgotten - including the bad parts.

We've tried to write content that takes its world seriously without taking itself too seriously. There's darkness here, but also absurdity. There's tragedy, but also penguins having very serious debates about trade policy.

If you find yourself genuinely invested in the fate of a procedurally generated penguin merchant guild, we've done our job.

## Still Under Construction

This is an ongoing project. The simulation is being refined. The enrichment is being improved. New content is being generated and old content is being culled when it doesn't work.

What you're seeing is a snapshot of an evolving system. Check back later and things will have changed. Hopefully for the better.

In the meantime, enjoy the ice. Watch out for orcas. And remember: the ice remembers.
