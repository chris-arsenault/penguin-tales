They trade, worship, use magic and advanced technology, and fend off the occasional Orca Raid.\n\n\n## Culture Visual Identities\nUse these as grounding for culturally-specific trait categories:\n### World\nTranscendent entities that belong to no single culture.\n\n### Aurora Stack\nThe orderly, sunlit colony on the bright face of Aurora Berg\n\n### Nightfall Shelf\nThe shadowed colony on the dark side of Aurora Berg\n\n### Orca Raiders\nThe fearsome orca predators of the deep waters\n\n## Current Palette Categories\n(no categories yet)\n\n## Required Visual Dimensions\nEach category you create should map to ONE of these independent dimensions:\n- FORM: Body shape, proportions, silhouette, posture\n- SURFACE: Skin/feather patterns, colors, textures, markings\n- CONDITION: Age, wear, scars, enhancements, health\n- MOVEMENT: Gait, mannerisms, how they carry themselves\n- EQUIPMENT: Clothing, tools, accessories, adornments\n- PRESENCE: Environmental effects, aura, space they occupy\n\nEnsure coverage across dimensions. If current palette over-indexes on one dimension (e.g., multiple \"supernatural aura\" categories), remove duplicates and add categories from underrepresented dimensions.\n\n## Your Task\n\n1. **AUDIT FOR OVERLAP**: Review current categories. Identify any that:\n   - Describe the same visual dimension differently\n   - Would produce similar-looking traits\n   - Are too abstract/generic to guide an artist\n   Mark overlapping categories for removal or merging.\n\n2. **EXPAND WITH ORTHOGONALITY**: Add 5-8 NEW categories ensuring:\n   - Each maps to a DIFFERENT dimension than existing categories\n   - Each produces visually DISTINCT results from all others\n   - Mix of mundane (natural variation) and supernatural\n\n3. **GROUND IN WORLD**: Reference specific world elements:\n   - Cultural practices, factions, traditions\n   - Environmental adaptations\n   - Historical events that left marks\n   - Technology or magic available\n\n4. **EXAMPLES MATTER**: Provide 3-5 specific, diverse examples per category. Examples should:\n   - Be concrete enough to draw\n   - Show the RANGE within the category\n   - Include at least one mundane and one dramatic option\n\n## Output Format (JSON only, no markdown)\n\n{\n  \"removedCategories\": [\"id1\", \"id2\"],\n  \"mergedCategories\": [\n    {\n      \"keepId\": \"palette_xxx\",\n      \"mergeFromIds\": [\"palette_yyy\"],\n      \"newDescription\": \"Combined description\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"newCategories\": [\n    {\n      \"category\": \"Category Name\",\n      \"dimension\": \"Which dimension this covers (FORM/SURFACE/etc)\",\n      \"description\": \"What this category means - be specific to the world\",\n      \"examples\": [\"Concrete example 1\", \"Concrete example 2\", \"Concrete example 3\"]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON.
