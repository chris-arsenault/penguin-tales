They believe knowledge hoarded is power preserved - share only what you must.\\n- SPEECH: Elliptical, coded, full of double meanings. They speak in proverbs that sound simple but contain warnings. Silence is respected more than speech.\\n- FEARS: Fire going out. Tunnels collapsing. Surface-dwellers learning their secrets. The ice remembering something they buried.\\n- TABOOS: Revealing tunnel routes to outsiders, wasting fire, speaking your true name above ground, looking directly at aurora-light.\\nRELATIONSHIPS:\\n- leader_of: The Midnight Claws (faction) [strong]\\n- leader_of: Nightfall Shelf (location) [strong]\\n- resident_of: Nightfall Shelf (location) [strong]\\n- practitioner_of: Star Ice Spiral (abilities) [weak]\\n- taught_by: Sosvoevae (npc) [weak]\\nCULTURAL PEERS: Nightfall Shelf, The Midnight Claws, Sheen Liofio\\nERA: The Frozen Peace\\n---\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\nThis is a character in The Berg. Focus on what makes them distinctive as a person.\\n\\nTheir relationships define them:\\n\\nReveal personality through concrete details:\\n- What they carry, wear, or refuse to touch\\n- Physical tics, scars, or habits that tell a story\\n- What they've lost or what they're protecting\\n- How others react to them (fear, respect, pity, avoidance)\\n\\nTheir  role shapes their worldview. Their  status affects how others see them.\\n\\nCHARACTER VOICE:\\n- No one is purely good or evil. Everyone has costs, compromises, or things they won't talk about.\\n- Don't explain their psychology. Let their actions and objects speak.\\n- Include one uncomfortable or unglamorous detail - a coward's streak, a cruel habit, an old shame.\\n- Characters should feel like they existed before this moment and will continue after it.\\n\\nBITTER CAMARADERIE:\\n- Show how others remember them, mourn them, or joke about them\\n- Include a relationship detail that's darkly funny or stubbornly loyal\\n- Someone carries their token. Someone still curses their name fondly. Someone refuses to sit in their chair.\\n- Not every character dies. Some survive and carry the weight. Some are simply... still here.\\n\\nSYNTACTIC POETRY:\\nAim for compressed power: 'First in; last out; for the last time.' Use semicolons to do the work of paragraphs. Repetition with variation. What's unsaid hits hardest.\\nTONE:\\nDark, war-weary fantasy in the tradition of Malazan Book of the Fallen, Brent Weeks, and the Powder Mage trilogy. History is written by survivors who remember the cost. Tragedy happens without ceremony - important figures die in half-sentences, battles end mid-action, and not everything resolves.\\n\\nSTYLE PRINCIPLES:\\n- Specificity over abstraction: Not 'a weapon' but 'a fire-core hammer with a cracked head.' Not 'he felt sad' but 'his flippers wouldn't stop shaking.'\\n- Show through action and object, not introspection: Characters reveal themselves by what they do, carry, avoid, or destroy - not by what they 'realize' or 'understand.'\\n- Subtext over statement: Let implications land. If someone betrayed their colony, don't say they feel guilty - mention they haven't visited the memorial.\\n- Uncomfortable details: Include the ugly, inconvenient, or unresolved. A hero's hands might be scarred from something shameful. A victory might cost more than it was worth.\\n- Trust the reader: Don't explain metaphors. Don't summarize lessons. End on images, not morals.\\n\\nSYNTACTIC POETRY:\\nAim for the compressed power of 'First in; last out; for the last time.' Sentences that carry weight through rhythm and omission. Not fragmented violence, but poetic compression - where what's left unsaid hits harder than what's spoken. Semicolons can do the work of paragraphs. Repetition with variation creates resonance.\\n\\nBITTER CAMARADERIE:\\nThis is essential. Grimness alone is exhausting. Include:\\n- Dark humor between allies - jokes that wouldn't be funny if you hadn't been there\\n- Loyalty that persists despite betrayal, stupidity, or failure\\n- Small kindnesses in terrible contexts - sharing rations, remembering names, carrying someone's token\\n- Soldiers/workers who mock the causes they'll die for\\n- The way people become family through shared suffering, not shared values\\n- Irony that isn't cruel - the bitter laugh, not the sneer\\n\\nExample: Don't just say 'he died in the raid.' Say 'He died in the raid. Kaela still sets out two cups when she brews fire-tea.'\\n\\nSTRUCTURAL VARIETY:\\n- Not every entity needs a death beat. Some are alive. Some mysteries stay mysteries.\\n- Some endings are mid-action, unresolved. Some are quiet. Some are bitter-funny.\\n- Vary the emotional shape: tragedy, irony, stubborn hope, grim humor, unearned survival.\\n\\nAVOID THESE AI TELLS:\\n- Balance words: yet, however, still, ultimately, in the end, nevertheless\\n- Introspection clichés: 'couldn't help but feel,' 'realized that,' 'in that moment,' 'understood that'\\n- Polite diction: gentle, quiet, subtle, bittersweet, meaningful, profound\\n- Vague sensory: warm, soft, heavy silence, cool breeze (anchor these to specifics or cut them)\\n- Flat metaphors: light=hope, darkness=fear, storms=turmoil (find stranger, more specific images)\\n- Clean resolutions: Not everything works out. Some things stay broken.\\n- Time-skipping without texture: Don't write 'days passed' - either skip entirely or make the waiting hurt\\n- RELENTLESS GRIMNESS: If everything is dark, nothing is. Leaven tragedy with dark humor, bitter irony, or stubborn human connection.\\n\\nDescriptions should read as if written by a war-chronicle keeper or a faction historian with biases, blind spots, and something to prove.\\nCONSTRAINTS:\\nNever contradict these facts: The Berg is a supernatural iceberg of impossible scale - large enough to contain mountains, caverns, and multiple civilizations. It drifts through an endless frozen sea under perpetual twilight., Penguins evolved sapience through exposure to aurora-light over millennia. They possess flipper-dexterity comparable to human hands and stand upright habitually., Two penguin civilizations exist: the Aurora Stack (surface dwellers who worship the sky-lights) and the Nightshelf (tunnel dwellers who mine fire from the berg's volcanic core)., Orca pods are intelligent raiders from the surrounding sea. They worship a dead god whose corpse drifts somewhere in the deep, and conduct blood-rituals to wake it., Magic on The Berg draws from three sources: aurora-light (ice/crystal/divination), captured fire (forge/transformation/destruction), and pressure-depth (blood/force/communion with the deep)., The Berg's ice remembers. Ancient events leave literal impressions - frozen scenes, echo-sounds, emotional residue. The deeper you go, the older the memories., No penguin has ever successfully left The Berg and returned. The frozen sea is infinite in all directions. Some say The Berg is the only land that exists., The two colonies maintain an uneasy peace through the Flipper Accord - a trade agreement where surface aurora-crystals exchange for deep fire-cores. Neither can survive without the other's resource.\\n\\nWork WITH the existing description if present, expanding rather than replacing.\\nDon't invent major relationships not implied by the data - the relationships provided are canonical.\\n\\nSTYLE ENFORCEMENT:\\n- No balance words (yet, however, still, ultimately, nevertheless)\\n- No introspection clichés (realized, understood, couldn't help but feel)\\n- No polite abstractions (gentle, subtle, meaningful, profound)\\n- Ground every sensory detail in something specific\\n- End on an image or action, not a summary or lesson\\n- If something is broken or ugly, let it stay that way\"}]}",

When the ice cracked and the sea boiled beneath, when half the Aether-conclave argued for retreat into the deep tunnels, she stood in what would become Market Muvomen and carved the weapon from raw aurora-light and desperation. Three days of channeling; the Lance punched through a tidal surge that would have drowned the Stack entire. It also burned her from the inside out—flippers to spine to beak. They found her frozen mid-gesture, one wing still raised toward the receding water. The Lance remains where she died, embedded in the market's central pillar; merchants hang their wares from its crystalline barbs and nobody sits in the shadow it casts at third-cycle. Her name became a constellation-chart reference for 'sacrifice that worked,' which she would have hated—Sosinowen spoke often and bitterly about the difference between martyrdom and necessity. The Aether-conclave still meets in her old rookery; they leave her perch empty, not out of respect, but because the ice there remembers her arguments and whispers them back in her voice when the aurora flares.",

The Council keeps the full technique locked behind apprenticeships that take years; what leaks to the Midnight Claws and independent brokers are fragments, dangerous half-knowledge that reads true until it doesn't. Nyla made her fortune selling corrupted star-maps to rival factions - three tunnel-teams died in false veins before Loam's auditors caught the pattern. The technique requires specific ice-clarity, fire-core proximity, and something the Council won't name in writing; those who try to force it in wrong tunnels report seeing spirals that spin backward, light that remembers things it shouldn't.

Focus on what it HAS DONE, not just what it IS.\\n\\nWho created or discovered it:\\n\\nThe  indicates how famous it is. The  shows its current condition.\\n\\nARTIFACT VOICE:\\n- Start with a physical detail that tells a story - a notch in the blade, a stain that won't come out, a crack that appeared after a specific use\\n- Artifacts earn their legends. What did this object DO that made it famous? Name a death, a victory, a betrayal.\\n- Include the cost. Powerful things demand something. What has this artifact taken from its wielders?\\n- Show the weight of history in how it's described - who held it last, who refuses to touch it, what happens to those who carry it too long\\n- If it's lost, show why no one has retrieved it. If it's held, show why no one has stolen it.\\n\\nAvoid: 'said to possess,' 'legends speak of,' 'those who wield it,' 'great power,' 'ancient and mysterious'\\nTONE:\\nDark, war-weary fantasy in the tradition of Malazan Book of the Fallen, Brent Weeks, and the Powder Mage trilogy. History is written by survivors who remember the cost. Tragedy happens without ceremony - important figures die in half-sentences, battles end mid-action, and not everything resolves.\\n\\nSTYLE PRINCIPLES:\\n- Specificity over abstraction: Not 'a weapon' but 'a fire-core hammer with a cracked head.' Not 'he felt sad' but 'his flippers wouldn't stop shaking.'\\n- Show through action and object, not introspection: Characters reveal themselves by what they do, carry, avoid, or destroy - not by what they 'realize' or 'understand.'\\n- Subtext over statement: Let implications land. If someone betrayed their colony, don't say they feel guilty - mention they haven't visited the memorial.\\n- Uncomfortable details: Include the ugly, inconvenient, or unresolved. A hero's hands might be scarred from something shameful. A victory might cost more than it was worth.\\n- Trust the reader: Don't explain metaphors. Don't summarize lessons. End on images, not morals.\\n\\nSYNTACTIC POETRY:\\nAim for the compressed power of 'First in; last out; for the last time.' Sentences that carry weight through rhythm and omission. Not fragmented violence, but poetic compression - where what's left unsaid hits harder than what's spoken. Semicolons can do the work of paragraphs. Repetition with variation creates resonance.\\n\\nBITTER CAMARADERIE:\\nThis is essential. Grimness alone is exhausting. Include:\\n- Dark humor between allies - jokes that wouldn't be funny if you hadn't been there\\n- Loyalty that persists despite betrayal, stupidity, or failure\\n- Small kindnesses in terrible contexts - sharing rations, remembering names, carrying someone's token\\n- Soldiers/workers who mock the causes they'll die for\\n- The way people become family through shared suffering, not shared values\\n- Irony that isn't cruel - the bitter laugh, not the sneer\\n\\nExample: Don't just say 'he died in the raid.' Say 'He died in the raid. Kaela still sets out two cups when she brews fire-tea.'\\n\\nSTRUCTURAL VARIETY:\\n- Not every entity needs a death beat. Some are alive. Some mysteries stay mysteries.\\n- Some endings are mid-action, unresolved. Some are quiet. Some are bitter-funny.\\n- Vary the emotional shape: tragedy, irony, stubborn hope, grim humor, unearned survival.\\n\\nAVOID THESE AI TELLS:\\n- Balance words: yet, however, still, ultimately, in the end, nevertheless\\n- Introspection clichés: 'couldn't help but feel,' 'realized that,' 'in that moment,' 'understood that'\\n- Polite diction: gentle, quiet, subtle, bittersweet, meaningful, profound\\n- Vague sensory: warm, soft, heavy silence, cool breeze (anchor these to specifics or cut them)\\n- Flat metaphors: light=hope, darkness=fear, storms=turmoil (find stranger, more specific images)\\n- Clean resolutions: Not everything works out. Some things stay broken.\\n- Time-skipping without texture: Don't write 'days passed' - either skip entirely or make the waiting hurt\\n- RELENTLESS GRIMNESS: If everything is dark, nothing is. Leaven tragedy with dark humor, bitter irony, or stubborn human connection.\\n\\nDescriptions should read as if written by a war-chronicle keeper or a faction historian with biases, blind spots, and something to prove.\\nCONSTRAINTS:\\nNever contradict these facts: The Berg is a supernatural iceberg of impossible scale - large enough to contain mountains, caverns, and multiple civilizations. It drifts through an endless frozen sea under perpetual twilight., Penguins evolved sapience through exposure to aurora-light over millennia. They possess flipper-dexterity comparable to human hands and stand upright habitually., Two penguin civilizations exist: the Aurora Stack (surface dwellers who worship the sky-lights) and the Nightshelf (tunnel dwellers who mine fire from the berg's volcanic core)., Orca pods are intelligent raiders from the surrounding sea. They worship a dead god whose corpse drifts somewhere in the deep, and conduct blood-rituals to wake it., Magic on The Berg draws from three sources: aurora-light (ice/crystal/divination), captured fire (forge/transformation/destruction), and pressure-depth (blood/force/communion with the deep)., The Berg's ice remembers. Ancient events leave literal impressions - frozen scenes, echo-sounds, emotional residue. The deeper you go, the older the memories., No penguin has ever successfully left The Berg and returned. The frozen sea is infinite in all directions. Some say The Berg is the only land that exists., The two colonies maintain an uneasy peace through the Flipper Accord - a trade agreement where surface aurora-crystals exchange for deep fire-cores. Neither can survive without the other's resource.\\n\\nWork WITH the existing description if present, expanding rather than replacing.\\nDon't invent major relationships not implied by the data - the relationships provided are canonical.\\n\\nSTYLE ENFORCEMENT:\\n- No balance words (yet, however, still, ultimately, nevertheless)\\n- No introspection clichés (realized, understood, couldn't help but feel)\\n- No polite abstractions (gentle, subtle, meaningful, profound)\\n- Ground every sensory detail in something specific\\n- End on an image or action, not a summary or lesson\\n- If something is broken or ugly, let it stay that way\"}]}",

Evoke what it's like to STAND here - not what it represents.\\n\\nWhat entities are connected to this location?\\n\\nThe  level suggests how well-known or hidden it is.\\n\\nLOCATION VOICE:\\n- Anchor description in ONE specific sensory detail first - a smell, a sound, a texture underfoot. Not 'cold' but 'the kind of cold that makes your beak ache.'\\n- Show what HAPPENED here. Places carry scars. What stain won't come out? What crack was never repaired?\\n- Who controls it NOW vs. who BUILT it. Layers of history in one place.\\n\\nBITTER CAMARADERIE:\\n- Show how people USE this place - the regulars, the rituals, the unwritten rules\\n- Include one detail of stubborn life: graffiti, offerings, repairs made with wrong materials, someone's initials carved where they shouldn't be\\n- Not every location is haunted or dangerous. Some are just tired. Some are beloved despite being ugly.\\n- What joke do locals tell about this place? What do they refuse to call it by its official name?\\n\\nSYNTACTIC POETRY:\\n'First in; last out; for the last time.' Compressed weight. End on a sensory detail or an absence.\\n\\nAvoid: 'a place of great importance,' 'known for its,' 'visitors often remark,' 'atmosphere of peace/mystery/danger'\\nTONE:\\nDark, war-weary fantasy in the tradition of Malazan Book of the Fallen, Brent Weeks, and the Powder Mage trilogy. History is written by survivors who remember the cost. Tragedy happens without ceremony - important figures die in half-sentences, battles end mid-action, and not everything resolves.\\n\\nSTYLE PRINCIPLES:\\n- Specificity over abstraction: Not 'a weapon' but 'a fire-core hammer with a cracked head.' Not 'he felt sad' but 'his flippers wouldn't stop shaking.'\\n- Show through action and object, not introspection: Characters reveal themselves by what they do, carry, avoid, or destroy - not by what they 'realize' or 'understand.'\\n- Subtext over statement: Let implications land. If someone betrayed their colony, don't say they feel guilty - mention they haven't visited the memorial.\\n- Uncomfortable details: Include the ugly, inconvenient, or unresolved. A hero's hands might be scarred from something shameful. A victory might cost more than it was worth.\\n- Trust the reader: Don't explain metaphors. Don't summarize lessons. End on images, not morals.\\n\\nSYNTACTIC POETRY:\\nAim for the compressed power of 'First in; last out; for the last time.' Sentences that carry weight through rhythm and omission. Not fragmented violence, but poetic compression - where what's left unsaid hits harder than what's spoken. Semicolons can do the work of paragraphs. Repetition with variation creates resonance.\\n\\nBITTER CAMARADERIE:\\nThis is essential. Grimness alone is exhausting. Include:\\n- Dark humor between allies - jokes that wouldn't be funny if you hadn't been there\\n- Loyalty that persists despite betrayal, stupidity, or failure\\n- Small kindnesses in terrible contexts - sharing rations, remembering names, carrying someone's token\\n- Soldiers/workers who mock the causes they'll die for\\n- The way people become family through shared suffering, not shared values\\n- Irony that isn't cruel - the bitter laugh, not the sneer\\n\\nExample: Don't just say 'he died in the raid.' Say 'He died in the raid. Kaela still sets out two cups when she brews fire-tea.'\\n\\nSTRUCTURAL VARIETY:\\n- Not every entity needs a death beat. Some are alive. Some mysteries stay mysteries.\\n- Some endings are mid-action, unresolved. Some are quiet. Some are bitter-funny.\\n- Vary the emotional shape: tragedy, irony, stubborn hope, grim humor, unearned survival.\\n\\nAVOID THESE AI TELLS:\\n- Balance words: yet, however, still, ultimately, in the end, nevertheless\\n- Introspection clichés: 'couldn't help but feel,' 'realized that,' 'in that moment,' 'understood that'\\n- Polite diction: gentle, quiet, subtle, bittersweet, meaningful, profound\\n- Vague sensory: warm, soft, heavy silence, cool breeze (anchor these to specifics or cut them)\\n- Flat metaphors: light=hope, darkness=fear, storms=turmoil (find stranger, more specific images)\\n- Clean resolutions: Not everything works out. Some things stay broken.\\n- Time-skipping without texture: Don't write 'days passed' - either skip entirely or make the waiting hurt\\n- RELENTLESS GRIMNESS: If everything is dark, nothing is. Leaven tragedy with dark humor, bitter irony, or stubborn human connection.\\n\\nDescriptions should read as if written by a war-chronicle keeper or a faction historian with biases, blind spots, and something to prove.\\nCONSTRAINTS:\\nNever contradict these facts: The Berg is a supernatural iceberg of impossible scale - large enough to contain mountains, caverns, and multiple civilizations. It drifts through an endless frozen sea under perpetual twilight., Penguins evolved sapience through exposure to aurora-light over millennia. They possess flipper-dexterity comparable to human hands and stand upright habitually., Two penguin civilizations exist: the Aurora Stack (surface dwellers who worship the sky-lights) and the Nightshelf (tunnel dwellers who mine fire from the berg's volcanic core)., Orca pods are intelligent raiders from the surrounding sea. They worship a dead god whose corpse drifts somewhere in the deep, and conduct blood-rituals to wake it., Magic on The Berg draws from three sources: aurora-light (ice/crystal/divination), captured fire (forge/transformation/destruction), and pressure-depth (blood/force/communion with the deep)., The Berg's ice remembers. Ancient events leave literal impressions - frozen scenes, echo-sounds, emotional residue. The deeper you go, the older the memories., No penguin has ever successfully left The Berg and returned. The frozen sea is infinite in all directions. Some say The Berg is the only land that exists., The two colonies maintain an uneasy peace through the Flipper Accord - a trade agreement where surface aurora-crystals exchange for deep fire-cores. Neither can survive without the other's resource.\\n\\nWork WITH the existing description if present, expanding rather than replacing.\\nDon't invent major relationships not implied by the data - the relationships provided are canonical.\\n\\nSTYLE ENFORCEMENT:\\n- No balance words (yet, however, still, ultimately, nevertheless)\\n- No introspection clichés (realized, understood, couldn't help but feel)\\n- No polite abstractions (gentle, subtle, meaningful, profound)\\n- Ground every sensory detail in something specific\\n- End on an image or action, not a summary or lesson\\n- If something is broken or ugly, let it stay that way\"}]}",

Her stall in the deep markets always smelled of old cold—the kind that predates penguin memory—and she spoke in prices that had nothing to do with fish or fire.

    "description": "No one remembers what the first raid was for—fire-cores, crystal spires, an insult at a trade meeting. What matters: the Aurora Stack split into three factions within a season, the Nightshelf into five, and suddenly everyone had a manifesto and a reason why their neighbors deserved to die. Fell's Vault was founded to preserve what would be lost; they cataloged artifacts while their collectors bled out in the tunnels. Veil-Keeper Sauriapheis rose during this time, whispering that the aurora itself demanded purity through violence—her followers wore prayer-scars and wouldn't trade with fire-miners even when their hatchlings froze. On the Nightshelf, Theolanoefivaenia carved the Neonupgaumaua into living ice, a ritual-mark that still burns cold in the deep places, a promise that some wounds don't close. The war didn't end with treaties; it ended when there weren't enough left to hold the quarries, when the aurora-channels went dark for want of maintainers, when fire-cores sat unmined because the tunnels were full of corpses no one would claim. They called it the Faction Wars as if factions were the problem. The problem was simpler: they forgot they lived on an iceberg, and the sea doesn't care about manifestos.",

They believe knowledge hoarded is power preserved - share only what you must.\\n- FEARS: Fire going out. Tunnels collapsing. Surface-dwellers learning their secrets. The ice remembering something they buried.\\nRELATIONSHIPS:\\n- created_during: The Faction Wars (era) [moderate]\\n- epicenter_of: Slew Theogiollaubiara (location) [strong]\\n- triggered_by: Shade's Ring (faction) [strong]\\n- active_during: The Faction Wars (era) [moderate]\\n- derived_from: Void Drift Frost (abilities) [moderate]\\nCULTURAL PEERS: Nightfall Shelf, The Midnight Claws, Shadow-Broker Nyla\\nERA: The Frozen Peace\\n---\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\nThis is an event in The Berg. Capture the moment as if recording it for a war chronicle.\\n\\nEntities involved:\\n\\nThe  indicates historical significance. As an  event, how present is it in memory?\\n\\nEVENT VOICE:\\n- Focus on what was LOST, BROKEN, or CHANGED FOREVER - not lessons learned\\n- Name the dead or the cost. History is paid for.\\n- Capture one visceral detail - the smell, the sound, the thing someone dropped and never picked up\\n- Don't explain significance. Let the facts do the work.\\n\\nBITTER CAMARADERIE:\\n- Show how survivors remember it - the dark jokes they tell, the things they won't discuss\\n- Include one detail of stubborn loyalty or absurd kindness amid chaos\\n- Someone carried someone else. Someone went back. Someone still flinches at a certain sound.\\n- Not every event is tragedy. Some are darkly comic. Some are just exhausting.\\n\\nSYNTACTIC POETRY:\\nAim for compressed power: 'First in; last out; for the last time.' Semicolons can do the work of paragraphs. End mid-action if it hits harder. What's unsaid resonates.\\n\\nAvoid: 'would come to be known as,' 'marked the beginning of,' 'in the aftermath,' 'they would never forget,' 'the survivors learned'\\nTONE:\\nDark, war-weary fantasy in the tradition of Malazan Book of the Fallen, Brent Weeks, and the Powder Mage trilogy. History is written by survivors who remember the cost. Tragedy happens without ceremony - important figures die in half-sentences, battles end mid-action, and not everything resolves.\\n\\nSTYLE PRINCIPLES:\\n- Specificity over abstraction: Not 'a weapon' but 'a fire-core hammer with a cracked head.' Not 'he felt sad' but 'his flippers wouldn't stop shaking.'\\n- Show through action and object, not introspection: Characters reveal themselves by what they do, carry, avoid, or destroy - not by what they 'realize' or 'understand.'\\n- Subtext over statement: Let implications land. If someone betrayed their colony, don't say they feel guilty - mention they haven't visited the memorial.\\n- Uncomfortable details: Include the ugly, inconvenient, or unresolved. A hero's hands might be scarred from something shameful. A victory might cost more than it was worth.\\n- Trust the reader: Don't explain metaphors. Don't summarize lessons. End on images, not morals.\\n\\nSYNTACTIC POETRY:\\nAim for the compressed power of 'First in; last out; for the last time.' Sentences that carry weight through rhythm and omission. Not fragmented violence, but poetic compression - where what's left unsaid hits harder than what's spoken. Semicolons can do the work of paragraphs. Repetition with variation creates resonance.\\n\\nBITTER CAMARADERIE:\\nThis is essential. Grimness alone is exhausting. Include:\\n- Dark humor between allies - jokes that wouldn't be funny if you hadn't been there\\n- Loyalty that persists despite betrayal, stupidity, or failure\\n- Small kindnesses in terrible contexts - sharing rations, remembering names, carrying someone's token\\n- Soldiers/workers who mock the causes they'll die for\\n- The way people become family through shared suffering, not shared values\\n- Irony that isn't cruel - the bitter laugh, not the sneer\\n\\nExample: Don't just say 'he died in the raid.' Say 'He died in the raid. Kaela still sets out two cups when she brews fire-tea.'\\n\\nSTRUCTURAL VARIETY:\\n- Not every entity needs a death beat. Some are alive. Some mysteries stay mysteries.\\n- Some endings are mid-action, unresolved. Some are quiet. Some are bitter-funny.\\n- Vary the emotional shape: tragedy, irony, stubborn hope, grim humor, unearned survival.\\n\\nAVOID THESE AI TELLS:\\n- Balance words: yet, however, still, ultimately, in the end, nevertheless\\n- Introspection clichés: 'couldn't help but feel,' 'realized that,' 'in that moment,' 'understood that'\\n- Polite diction: gentle, quiet, subtle, bittersweet, meaningful, profound\\n- Vague sensory: warm, soft, heavy silence, cool breeze (anchor these to specifics or cut them)\\n- Flat metaphors: light=hope, darkness=fear, storms=turmoil (find stranger, more specific images)\\n- Clean resolutions: Not everything works out. Some things stay broken.\\n- Time-skipping without texture: Don't write 'days passed' - either skip entirely or make the waiting hurt\\n- RELENTLESS GRIMNESS: If everything is dark, nothing is. Leaven tragedy with dark humor, bitter irony, or stubborn human connection.\\n\\nDescriptions should read as if written by a war-chronicle keeper or a faction historian with biases, blind spots, and something to prove.\\nCONSTRAINTS:\\nNever contradict these facts: The Berg is a supernatural iceberg of impossible scale - large enough to contain mountains, caverns, and multiple civilizations. It drifts through an endless frozen sea under perpetual twilight., Penguins evolved sapience through exposure to aurora-light over millennia. They possess flipper-dexterity comparable to human hands and stand upright habitually., Two penguin civilizations exist: the Aurora Stack (surface dwellers who worship the sky-lights) and the Nightshelf (tunnel dwellers who mine fire from the berg's volcanic core)., Orca pods are intelligent raiders from the surrounding sea. They worship a dead god whose corpse drifts somewhere in the deep, and conduct blood-rituals to wake it., Magic on The Berg draws from three sources: aurora-light (ice/crystal/divination), captured fire (forge/transformation/destruction), and pressure-depth (blood/force/communion with the deep)., The Berg's ice remembers. Ancient events leave literal impressions - frozen scenes, echo-sounds, emotional residue. The deeper you go, the older the memories., No penguin has ever successfully left The Berg and returned. The frozen sea is infinite in all directions. Some say The Berg is the only land that exists., The two colonies maintain an uneasy peace through the Flipper Accord - a trade agreement where surface aurora-crystals exchange for deep fire-cores. Neither can survive without the other's resource.\\n\\nWork WITH the existing description if present, expanding rather than replacing.\\nDon't invent major relationships not implied by the data - the relationships provided are canonical.\\n\\nSTYLE ENFORCEMENT:\\n- No balance words (yet, however, still, ultimately, nevertheless)\\n- No introspection clichés (realized, understood, couldn't help but feel)\\n- No polite abstractions (gentle, subtle, meaningful, profound)\\n- Ground every sensory detail in something specific\\n- End on an image or action, not a summary or lesson\\n- If something is broken or ugly, let it stay that way\"}]}",
