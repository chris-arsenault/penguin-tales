The Luminarch Of Starshatter, watching their access to these vital flows strangled, had no choice but to answer. What followed was a war fought as much in the shimmer-spaces as on ice, where precision and understanding mattered more than numbers. The nightshelf colonies discovered they could bleed without dying, could lose territory and still survive, but could not lose the ability to think, to strategize, to adapt.
