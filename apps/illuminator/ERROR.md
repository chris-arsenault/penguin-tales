The temperature holds steady at -72.1, cold enough that the ice never weeps, and the penguins here have learned to read the shelf's moods the way merchants read ledgers, trading their surplus resources with Nightfall Shelf while maintaining the careful distance of neighbors who've seen what desperation can do.
