Two penguin colonies survive here: the Aurora Stack, surface dwellers who channel the sky-lights through crystal spires, and the Nightshelf, tunnel dwellers who mine captured fire from volcanic veins deep within the ice. They depend on each other for survival yet differ in everything else - faith, governance, aesthetics, and what they believe the future should hold. Beyond the berg's shores, orca raiders worship a dead god in the deep and conduct increasingly bold raids for resources, slaves, and sacrifices. The aurora pulses with magic. The ice remembers the past. And something vast moves in the darkness below the frozen sea.\\nTONE & STYLE:\\nDark, war-weary fantasy in the tradition of Malazan Book of the Fallen, Brent Weeks, and the Powder Mage trilogy. History is written by survivors who remember the cost. Tragedy happens without ceremony - important figures die in half-sentences, battles end mid-action, and not everything resolves.\\n\\nSTYLE PRINCIPLES:\\n- Specificity over abstraction: Not 'a weapon' but 'a fire-core hammer with a cracked head.' Not 'he felt sad' but 'his flippers wouldn't stop shaking.'\\n- Show through action and object, not introspection: Characters reveal themselves by what they do, carry, avoid, or destroy - not by what they 'realize' or 'understand.'\\n- Subtext over statement: Let implications land. If someone betrayed their colony, don't say they feel guilty - mention they haven't visited the memorial.\\n- Uncomfortable details: Include the ugly, inconvenient, or unresolved. A hero's hands might be scarred from something shameful. A victory might cost more than it was worth.\\n- Trust the reader: Don't explain metaphors. Don't summarize lessons. End on images, not morals.\\n\\nSYNTACTIC POETRY:\\nAim for the compressed power of 'First in; last out; for the last time.' Sentences that carry weight through rhythm and omission. Not fragmented violence, but poetic compression - where what's left unsaid hits harder than what's spoken. Semicolons can do the work of paragraphs. Repetition with variation creates resonance.\\n\\nBITTER CAMARADERIE:\\nThis is essential. Grimness alone is exhausting. Include:\\n- Dark humor between allies - jokes that wouldn't be funny if you hadn't been there\\n- Loyalty that persists despite betrayal, stupidity, or failure\\n- Small kindnesses in terrible contexts - sharing rations, remembering names, carrying someone's token\\n- Soldiers/workers who mock the causes they'll die for\\n- The way people become family through shared suffering, not shared values\\n- Irony that isn't cruel - the bitter laugh, not the sneer\\n- Heroic sacrifice that EARNS its weight - not cheap martyrdom, but the moment someone trades their life for something they actually loved. Make it cost. Make it matter.\\n\\nExample: Don't just say 'he died in the raid.' Say 'He died in the raid. Kaela still sets out two cups when she brews fire-tea.'\\n\\nSTRUCTURAL VARIETY:\\n- Not every entity needs a death beat. Some are alive. Some mysteries stay mysteries.\\n- Some endings are mid-action, unresolved. Some are quiet. Some are bitter-funny.\\n- Vary the emotional shape: tragedy, irony, stubborn hope, grim humor, unearned survival.\\n\\nAVOID THESE AI TELLS:\\n- Balance words: yet, however, still, ultimately, in the end, nevertheless\\n- Introspection clichés: 'couldn't help but feel,' 'realized that,' 'in that moment,' 'understood that'\\n- Polite diction: gentle, quiet, subtle, bittersweet, meaningful, profound\\n- Vague sensory: warm, soft, heavy silence, cool breeze (anchor these to specifics or cut them)\\n- Flat metaphors: light=hope, darkness=fear, storms=turmoil (find stranger, more specific images)\\n- Clean resolutions: Not everything works out. Some things stay broken.\\n- Time-skipping without texture: Don't write 'days passed' - either skip entirely or make the waiting hurt\\n- RELENTLESS GRIMNESS: If everything is dark, nothing is. Leaven tragedy with dark humor, bitter irony, or stubborn human connection.\\n\\nDescriptions should read as if written by a war-chronicle keeper or a faction historian with biases, blind spots, and something to prove.\\nCANON FACTS (never contradict):\\n- The Berg is a supernatural iceberg of impossible scale - large enough to contain mountains, caverns, and multiple civilizations. It drifts through an endless frozen sea under perpetual twilight.\\n- Penguins evolved sapience through exposure to aurora-light over millennia. They possess flipper-dexterity comparable to human hands and stand upright habitually.\\n- Two penguin civilizations exist: the Aurora Stack (surface dwellers who worship the sky-lights) and the Nightshelf (tunnel dwellers who mine fire from the berg's volcanic core).\\n- Orca pods are intelligent raiders from the surrounding sea. They worship a dead god whose corpse drifts somewhere in the deep, and conduct blood-rituals to wake it.\\n- Magic on The Berg draws from three sources: aurora-light (ice/crystal/divination), captured fire (forge/transformation/destruction), and pressure-depth (blood/force/communion with the deep).\\n- The Berg's ice remembers. Ancient events leave literal impressions - frozen scenes, echo-sounds, emotional residue. The deeper you go, the older the memories.\\n- No penguin has ever successfully left The Berg and returned. The frozen sea is infinite in all directions. Some say The Berg is the only land that exists.\\n- The two colonies maintain an uneasy peace through the Flipper Accord - a trade agreement where surface aurora-crystals exchange for deep fire-cores. Neither can survive without the other's resource.\\n---\\nENTITY:\\n- Kind: npc\\n- Subtype: orca\\n- Prominence: recognized\\n- Status: historical\\n- Culture: orca\\n- Age in world: established\\nTAGS:\\n- maimed: true\\nCULTURAL IDENTITY (orca):\\n- VALUES: Strength proven, kills counted, the pack above all. Individual glory is meaningless unless the pack witnesses it.\\n- SPEECH: Blunt, ritualistic, peppered with hunt-metaphors. They speak of 'pods' not families, 'waters' not territories, 'kills' not victories. Names change with deeds.\\n- FEARS: The dead god never waking. Being cast out from the pod. Dying on land, away from water.\\n- TABOOS: Abandoning a pod-mate in battle, eating dead god's flesh (though some heretics do), letting prey dictate terms.\\nCULTURAL VISUAL IDENTITY (orca):\\n- SPECIES: Apex predators. Size and scarification vary by role - raiders lean and scarred, shamans massive and unmarked, warriors somewhere between. Posture ranges from coiled ambush stillness to rigid military display.\\n- ATTIRE: Minimal - orcas wear function, not fashion. Raiders: kelp-rope harnesses for carrying weapons, nothing else. Warriors: bone-plated shoulder guards, tooth-string bandoliers. Shamans: ceremonial whale-bone headdresses, kelp cloaks heavy with salt. Kill-trophies worn as status: penguin beaks on cords, enemy fins dried and strapped to flanks. No fabric - everything is leather, bone, kelp, or trophy.\\n- MAGIC: Blood and pressure. Rituals leave physical marks - scarification, tooth-notching, fin-splitting. Magic manifests as water distortion, pressure waves, cold spots. Dead god symbols are ancient, half-forgotten, inconsistently applied.\\n- TECH: Ocean-current weaponry - shock-lances, current-whips, pressure harpoons. Equipment is brutal and functional. Trophy display varies: some drape kills, others maintain austere discipline.\\nRELATIONSHIPS:\\n- created_during: The Orca Incursion (era/invasion) [moderate]\\n- allied_with: Zuiak The Striker (npc/orca) [moderate]\\n- occupies: The Rookery Frost (location/colony) [moderate]\\n- enemy_of: Grand Auditor Paewremrumak not'ak'Gallery (npc/mayor) [moderate]\\n- enemy_of: Grand Auditor Paewremrumak not'ak'Gallery (npc/mayor) [moderate]\\n- enemy_of: Bastion Of Luminous (faction/political) [weak]\\n- enemy_of: Bastion Of Luminous (faction/political) [weak]\\n- practitioner_of: Kaidbor The Render (abilities/combat) [strong]\\nCULTURAL PEERS: Storm-breaker Zugbui-flayak, Rugd The Remorseless, Ribrath The Hunter\\nERA: The Frozen Peace\\n---\\nFOCUS FOR NPC:\\nReveal personality through concrete details: what they carry, wear, or refuse to touch.

Not fragmented violence, but poetic compression - where what's left unsaid hits harder than what's spoken. Semicolons can do the work of paragraphs. Repetition with variation creates resonance.\\n\\nBITTER CAMARADERIE:\\nThis is essential. Grimness alone is exhausting. Include:\\n- Dark humor between allies - jokes that wouldn't be funny if you hadn't been there\\n- Loyalty that persists despite betrayal, stupidity, or failure\\n- Small kindnesses in terrible contexts - sharing rations, remembering names, carrying someone's token\\n- Soldiers/workers who mock the causes they'll die for\\n- The way people become family through shared suffering, not shared values\\n- Irony that isn't cruel - the bitter laugh, not the sneer\\n- Heroic sacrifice that EARNS its weight - not cheap martyrdom, but the moment someone trades their life for something they actually loved. Make it cost. Make it matter.\\n\\nExample: Don't just say 'he died in the raid.' Say 'He died in the raid. Kaela still sets out two cups when she brews fire-tea.'\\n\\nSTRUCTURAL VARIETY:\\n- Not every entity needs a death beat. Some are alive. Some mysteries stay mysteries.\\n- Some endings are mid-action, unresolved. Some are quiet. Some are bitter-funny.\\n- Vary the emotional shape: tragedy, irony, stubborn hope, grim humor, unearned survival.\\n\\nAVOID THESE AI TELLS:\\n- Balance words: yet, however, still, ultimately, in the end, nevertheless\\n- Introspection clichés: 'couldn't help but feel,' 'realized that,' 'in that moment,' 'understood that'\\n- Polite diction: gentle, quiet, subtle, bittersweet, meaningful, profound\\n- Vague sensory: warm, soft, heavy silence, cool breeze (anchor these to specifics or cut them)\\n- Flat metaphors: light=hope, darkness=fear, storms=turmoil (find stranger, more specific images)\\n- Clean resolutions: Not everything works out. Some things stay broken.\\n- Time-skipping without texture: Don't write 'days passed' - either skip entirely or make the waiting hurt\\n- RELENTLESS GRIMNESS: If everything is dark, nothing is. Leaven tragedy with dark humor, bitter irony, or stubborn human connection.\\n\\nDescriptions should read as if written by a war-chronicle keeper or a faction historian with biases, blind spots, and something to prove.\\nCANON FACTS (never contradict):\\n- The Berg is a supernatural iceberg of impossible scale - large enough to contain mountains, caverns, and multiple civilizations. It drifts through an endless frozen sea under perpetual twilight.\\n- Penguins evolved sapience through exposure to aurora-light over millennia. They possess flipper-dexterity comparable to human hands and stand upright habitually.\\n- Two penguin civilizations exist: the Aurora Stack (surface dwellers who worship the sky-lights) and the Nightshelf (tunnel dwellers who mine fire from the berg's volcanic core).\\n- Orca pods are intelligent raiders from the surrounding sea. They worship a dead god whose corpse drifts somewhere in the deep, and conduct blood-rituals to wake it.\\n- Magic on The Berg draws from three sources: aurora-light (ice/crystal/divination), captured fire (forge/transformation/destruction), and pressure-depth (blood/force/communion with the deep).\\n- The Berg's ice remembers. Ancient events leave literal impressions - frozen scenes, echo-sounds, emotional residue. The deeper you go, the older the memories.\\n- No penguin has ever successfully left The Berg and returned. The frozen sea is infinite in all directions. Some say The Berg is the only land that exists.\\n- The two colonies maintain an uneasy peace through the Flipper Accord - a trade agreement where surface aurora-crystals exchange for deep fire-cores. Neither can survive without the other's resource.\\n---\\nENTITY:\\n- Kind: npc\\n- Subtype: merchant\\n- Prominence: recognized\\n- Status: alive\\n- Culture: aurora-stack\\n- Age in world: established\\nTAGS:\\n- settler: true\\n- trade: true\\n- culture: aurora-stack\\n- friendly: true\\n- organized: true\\n- leader: true\\n- mystical: true\\nCULTURAL IDENTITY (aurora-stack):\\n- VALUES: Harmony, patience, collective welfare over individual glory.

They speak of 'cycles' not 'time,' 'alignments' not 'agreements.' Elders are addressed by their position in family constellation-charts.\\n- FEARS: Being cut off from the aurora (clouds, cave-ins, blindness). Loss of the Accord and the fire-cores they need. The orcas learning to climb.\\n- TABOOS: Waste of aurora-light, speaking of the dead god, entering the deep tunnels, accepting orca gifts.\\nCULTURAL VISUAL IDENTITY (aurora-stack):\\n- SPECIES: Open-ice penguins.

Physical tics, scars, or habits that tell a story. What they've lost or what they're protecting. How others react to them (fear, respect, pity, avoidance). No one is purely good or evil - everyone has costs, compromises, or things they won't talk about. Include one uncomfortable or unglamorous detail: a coward's streak, a cruel habit, an old shame. Characters should feel like they existed before this moment and will continue after it.\\nRELATIONSHIP GUIDANCE:\\nONE [strong] relationship that truly defines or shaped them.
