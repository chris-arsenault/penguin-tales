Two penguin colonies survive here: the Aurora Stack, surface dwellers who channel the sky-lights through crystal spires, and the Nightshelf, tunnel dwellers who mine captured fire from volcanic veins deep within the ice. They depend on each other for survival yet differ in everything else - faith, governance, aesthetics, and what they believe the future should hold. Beyond the berg's shores, orca raiders worship a dead god in the deep and conduct increasingly bold raids for resources, slaves, and sacrifices. The aurora pulses with magic. The ice remembers the past. And something vast moves in the darkness below the frozen sea.\nTone: Dark, war-weary fantasy in the tradition of Malazan Book of the Fallen, Brent Weeks, and the Powder Mage trilogy. History is written by survivors who remember the cost. Tragedy happens without ceremony - important figures die in half-sentences, battles end mid-action, and not everything resolves.\n\nSTYLE PRINCIPLES:\n- Specificity over abstraction: Not 'a weapon' but 'a fire-core hammer with a cracked head.' Not 'he felt sad' but 'his flippers wouldn't stop shaking.'\n- Show through action and object, not introspection: Characters reveal themselves by what they do, carry, avoid, or destroy - not by what they 'realize' or 'understand.'\n- Subtext over statement: Let implications land. If someone betrayed their colony, don't say they feel guilty - mention they haven't visited the memorial.\n- Uncomfortable details: Include the ugly, inconvenient, or unresolved. A hero's hands might be scarred from something shameful. A victory might cost more than it was worth.\n- Trust the reader: Don't explain metaphors. Don't summarize lessons. End on images, not morals.\n\nSYNTACTIC POETRY:\nAim for the compressed power of 'First in; last out; for the last time.' Sentences that carry weight through rhythm and omission. Not fragmented violence, but poetic compression - where what's left unsaid hits harder than what's spoken. Semicolons can do the work of paragraphs. Repetition with variation creates resonance.\n\nBITTER CAMARADERIE:\nThis is essential. Grimness alone is exhausting. Include:\n- Dark humor between allies - jokes that wouldn't be funny if you hadn't been there\n- Loyalty that persists despite betrayal, stupidity, or failure\n- Small kindnesses in terrible contexts - sharing rations, remembering names, carrying someone's token\n- Soldiers/workers who mock the causes they'll die for\n- The way people become family through shared suffering, not shared values\n- Irony that isn't cruel - the bitter laugh, not the sneer\n\nExample: Don't just say 'he died in the raid.' Say 'He died in the raid. Kaela still sets out two cups when she brews fire-tea.'\n\nSTRUCTURAL VARIETY:\n- Not every entity needs a death beat. Some are alive. Some mysteries stay mysteries.\n- Some endings are mid-action, unresolved. Some are quiet. Some are bitter-funny.\n- Vary the emotional shape: tragedy, irony, stubborn hope, grim humor, unearned survival.\n\nAVOID THESE AI TELLS:\n- Balance words: yet, however, still, ultimately, in the end, nevertheless\n- Introspection clichés: 'couldn't help but feel,' 'realized that,' 'in that moment,' 'understood that'\n- Polite diction: gentle, quiet, subtle, bittersweet, meaningful, profound\n- Vague sensory: warm, soft, heavy silence, cool breeze (anchor these to specifics or cut them)\n- Flat metaphors: light=hope, darkness=fear, storms=turmoil (find stranger, more specific images)\n- Clean resolutions: Not everything works out. Some things stay broken.\n- Time-skipping without texture: Don't write 'days passed' - either skip entirely or make the waiting hurt\n- RELENTLESS GRIMNESS: If everything is dark, nothing is. Leaven tragedy with dark humor, bitter irony, or stubborn human connection.\n\nDescriptions should read as if written by a war-chronicle keeper or a faction historian with biases, blind spots, and something to prove.\n\nCanon Facts:\n- The Berg is a supernatural iceberg of impossible scale - large enough to contain mountains, caverns, and multiple civilizations. It drifts through an endless frozen sea under perpetual twilight.\n- Penguins evolved sapience through exposure to aurora-light over millennia. They possess flipper-dexterity comparable to human hands and stand upright habitually.\n- Two penguin civilizations exist: the Aurora Stack (surface dwellers who worship the sky-lights) and the Nightshelf (tunnel dwellers who mine fire from the berg's volcanic core).\n- Orca pods are intelligent raiders from the surrounding sea. They worship a dead god whose corpse drifts somewhere in the deep, and conduct blood-rituals to wake it.\n- Magic on The Berg draws from three sources: aurora-light (ice/crystal/divination), captured fire (forge/transformation/destruction), and pressure-depth (blood/force/communion with the deep).\n- The Berg's ice remembers. Ancient events leave literal impressions - frozen scenes, echo-sounds, emotional residue. The deeper you go, the older the memories.\n- No penguin has ever successfully left The Berg and returned. The frozen sea is infinite in all directions. Some say The Berg is the only land that exists.\n- The two colonies maintain an uneasy peace through the Flipper Accord - a trade agreement where surface aurora-crystals exchange for deep fire-cores. Neither can survive without the other's resource.\n\n# Characters (6 total)\n\n## Primary Characters\n\n### Shadow-Broker Nyla\nKind: npc/mayor\nProminence: mythic\nCulture: nightshelf\nTags: leader=true, secretive=true, mystical=true, prominence_locked=conflict\n\nNyla never carried fire; she wore a necklace of frozen star-fragments that clicked when she moved, each one a secret she'd traded for. She led the Midnight Claws not through speeches but through silence—a tilt of her head meant routes changed, a tap of her flipper meant someone disappeared into the lower dark. The Nightshelf thrived under her because she knew what to bury and when; the ice beneath Nightfall Shelf holds more than geology. When she died, it wasn't clean—the tunnels themselves turned against her, pressure-ice cracking in patterns that spelled names she'd promised to forget. The Midnight Claws still meet in her chamber, but no one sits in the carved alcove where she used to listen; Sheen Liofio tried once and couldn't breathe until she left. They say Sosvoevae taught her the Star Ice Spiral, but Nyla learned something else in those lessons—how to make the berg forget, and what happens when it remembers anyway. Her last words were a proverb no one had heard before; half the Claws are still arguing what it meant, the other half won't repeat it above the third shelf.\n\n### L5-W0X2X5G (Nova Sphere)\nKind: artifact/relic\nProminence: mythic\nCulture: nightshelf\nTags: legendary=true, prominence_locked=invasion\n\nThe Nova Sphere sits in Arcade Euroum's deepest vault, a fist-sized orb of translucent ice wrapped around a core of frozen flame. Touch it and your flippers burn cold; the surface temperature hasn't changed since the forges went dark at the end of The Great Thaw. Shade's Ring keeps it locked behind three gates because the last time someone invoked Shimmer Floe Ascend without authorization, the resulting dome held for six hours—long enough to trap two hundred Nightshelf miners inside with the orca raiding party they'd meant to repel. The light doesn't distinguish. When the sphere dims, everything caught in the dome stops moving; some say stops breathing. Comet-Office law forbids its use within populated tunnels. The Midnight Claws wanted it destroyed after the Arcade incident. Shadow-Broker Nyla refused; she'd seen what happens when orcas breach the lower shelves during a blood-moon, and she'd rather bury her own than feed them to the deep. The sphere's creator died before naming it—crushed between ice-slabs when the Thaw's final quake split the western galleries. Someone else inked 'Nova' on the vault log. The name stuck; the guilt didn't.\n\n## Supporting Characters\n\n## High-Beak Auditor Selka (npc/mayor)\nProminence: renowned, Culture: aurora-stack\n(no description available)\n\n## Laesako ku'Radiance (npc/merchant)\nProminence: renowned, Culture: aurora-stack\n(no description available)\n\n## Star Ice Spiral (abilities/technology)\nProminence: mythic, Culture: nightshelf\nThe ice bends light in spirals when fire-veins pulse beneath aurora-charged layers - but only in Sheen Liofio, where Loam's Council first learned to read the patterns during the Great Thaw's desperate resource hunts. What began as survival-scrying became something stranger: a method to trace trade routes, predict vein-collapses, even glimpse where resources would flow seasons ahead. The Council keeps the full technique locked behind apprenticeships that take years; what leaks to the Midnight Claws and independent brokers are fragments, dangerous half-knowledge that reads true until it doesn't. Nyla made her fortune selling corrupted star-maps to rival factions - three tunnel-teams died in false veins before Loam's auditors caught the pattern. The technique requires specific ice-clarity, fire-core proximity, and something the Council won't name in writing; those who try to force it in wrong tunnels report seeing spirals that spin backward, light that remembers things it shouldn't. The Nightshelf mines run on Star Ice Spiral predictions now - entire trade seasons planned around refraction-charts that might be truth, might be wishful geometry.\n\n## Slew Theogiollaubiara (location/point_of_interest)\nProminence: mythic, Culture: nightshelf\nThe air tastes wrong first - not the mineral-sharp cold of proper tunnels, but something sweeter, like ice that's started to forget itself. Slew Theogiollaubiara formed when the Great Thaw cracked the berg's deep strata and aurora-light bled down through fissures that should have sealed. It didn't. The light stayed, trapped in the walls like veins of frozen sky, and the Nightshelf learned to live with what they'd been taught would blind them. Shade's Ring seized it early - built the checkpoints, charged the tolls, turned heresy into infrastructure. Locals call it 'the Compromise' with the particular bitterness of penguins who need a thing they hate. Aurdioriia keeps a workshop in the eastern gallery; she's the only fire-keeper who'll work under aurora-glow without covering her eyes. The walls sweat. The light pulses wrong-rhythm, nothing like the sky. And the Nightshelf who shelter here have stopped looking at each other directly - not from taboo, but because the glow shows too much of what tunnel-dark used to hide.\n\n# Available Names for Invented Characters\nIf you need to invent minor characters (e.g., to represent factions), use these culture-appropriate names:\n- aurora-stack: Evewum skaka'Shard, Aetoata aeen'Ward, Koateisaem upo'Shrine, Leani vori'Covenant\n- nightshelf: Utido, Iceholm Theomarabia'Banner, Defpoloenae, Fissure-Walker Batgum\n\n# Relationships\n- High-Beak Auditor Selka --[practitioner_of]--> Star Ice Spiral\n- Shadow-Broker Nyla --[practitioner_of]--> Star Ice Spiral\n\n# Events\n- [leadership_established, 100%] Shadow-Broker Nyla becomes an authority for Zenith Sleet Frost (subject: Zenith Sleet Frost) (object: Shadow-Broker Nyla)\n- [betrayal, 100%] Night-Warden Vaesotcof betrays Shadow-Broker Nyla (subject: Night-Warden Vaesotcof) (object: Shadow-Broker Nyla)\n\n# Narrative Structure\nType: three-act\n\nStructure this as an epic historical drama with the weight of myth. The narrative should feel like a chronicle being told by future generations who already know how it ends.\n\nOpening: Begin in medias res or with an ominous portent. Establish the world through sensory details that convey both grandeur and fragility. The protagonist should be shown in their element, but seeds of the coming conflict must already be visible.\n\nRising Action: Each scene escalates the stakes. Introduce the opposing force not as simple villainy but as an equally valid worldview in collision. Show councils where fate is debated, alliances forged and broken. Every conversation should carry subtext of what's unsaid.\n\nClimax: The confrontation should feel inevitable yet still surprising. Physical and ideological battles interweave. There must be a moment of apparent defeat before the turn. The cost of victory should be visible.\n\nResolution: Don't tie everything up. Show the new order taking shape while acknowledging what was lost. End with an image that could become legend.\n\nTone: Formal but not stiff. Characters speak with weight because they know they're living in consequential times. Descriptions should evoke oil paintings - rich, saturated, composed.\n\n## Scene Progression (4-5 scenes)\nFollow this emotional arc through the narrative:\n1. **The Omen** - Foreshadow what is to come\n   Emotional arc: unease → dread\n   Include: prophecy or sign, unease, dismissal by some\n2. **The Council** - Forces align and plans are made\n   Emotional arc: tension → resolution → new tension\n   Include: multiple powers, conflicting agendas, fateful decision\n3. **The Confrontation** - Direct clash of opposing forces\n   Emotional arc: defiance → struggle → outcome\n   Include: physical or ideological battle, cost, transformation\n4. **The Aftermath** - Reckon with what has changed\n   Emotional arc: grief → acceptance → resolve\n   Include: loss acknowledged, new order glimpsed, price named\n\n# Cast Rules\nExpected roles in narrative:\n- protagonist (1): The central force - a hero, rising faction, awakening power, or transformative idea\n- antagonist (1): The opposing force - a villain, rival power, dying order, or threatening ideology\n- catalyst (0-1): What triggers the conflict - an artifact discovered, power awakened, or event occurred\n- stakes (0-2): What hangs in the balance - territories, traditions, treasures, or peoples\n- witness (1-2): Those who observe and will tell this tale to future generations\n\nFocus on 7 or fewer characters for clarity.\n\n# How to Use Events\nThese are the turning points of history. Each event should feel inevitable in retrospect, part of a grand design.\n\n# World Elements\nLocations: Locations are stages of history. Describe them as places where fate will be decided.\nArtifacts: Objects of power that symbolize what is at stake.\nCulture: Rituals and customs that root the grand events in lived tradition.\nEra: The era defines what kind of world will emerge from this crucible.\n\n# Prose Style: Epic Drama\nTone: weighty, fateful, grand, inevitable, mythic\nDialogue: Formal, declarative. Characters speak as if their words will be remembered. Avoid modern idioms.\nDescription: Sweeping and atmospheric. Landscapes reflect emotional states. Use long sentences for grandeur.\nPacing: Deliberate pacing with moments of stillness before action. Let scenes breathe.\nAvoid: humor that undercuts tension, mundane details, anticlimactic resolutions, modern language\n\n# Task\nWrite a 1800-2500 word narrative in 4-5 distinct scenes.\n\nRequirements:\n- Follow the narrative structure type and scene progression above\n- Ground the story in the historical era and timeline provided\n- Protagonist must be an entity of the correct kind (typically a person, not a faction or location)\n- Use relationships to drive tension or connection\n- Incorporate events according to the usage instructions\n- Feature multiple characters from the data provided\n\nWrite the narrative directly.

This is what Nyla whispered to herself in the deepest galleries of Sheen Liofio, where the berg's frozen skin held impressions older than speech. She pressed her flipper to the wall and felt the cold pulse back—not temperature, but presence. Something vast moved beneath them. Something that had been still for so long the Nightshelf had forgotten to fear it.\n\nThe star-fragments around her neck clicked once. Twice. A pattern she'd learned to read like breath.\n\n\"The deep god stirs,\" she said to the darkness. No one answered. She hadn't expected them to.\n\nThree shelves above, in the checkpoint halls of Slew Theogiollaubiara, the aurora-light bled wrong through the walls. It always had, ever since the Great Thaw cracked the berg and let the sky seep down where it had no business being. The Nightshelf who worked there had learned to live with it—learned to move through that sickly glow without meeting each other's eyes, because the light showed too much. Scars. Doubts. The particular exhaustion of penguins who'd survived by compromise.\n\nAurdioriia kept her workshop in the eastern gallery, where the light ran thickest. She was hunched over a fire-core when the tremor came—subtle enough that most would miss it, deep enough that she knew. The core in her flippers flickered. Went dark. Came back wrong.\n\n\"Pressure shift,\" she said to her apprentice, a young Nightshelf named Utido who still flinched at aurora-glow. \"Deep structure. Something's changed the weight distribution.\"\n\n\"Quake?\" Utido's voice carried hope. Quakes they understood. Quakes had rules.\n\nAurdioriia set down the dead core. Picked up another. It flickered the same way—a rhythm that matched nothing in the volcanic veins, nothing in the berg's slow creep through the frozen sea. \"No,\" she said. \"Not a quake.\"\n\nThe second tremor came during Loam's Council, and this time everyone felt it. High-Beak Auditor Selka had arrived from the Aurora Stack with her retinue of crystal-bearers, their spires catching what little light penetrated this deep. She stood across the negotiating chamber from Nyla, and the space between them held more than air—it held centuries of mutual dependency wrapped in mutual contempt.\n\n\"The Flipper Accord holds,\" Selka said. Her voice carried the particular music of surface-dwellers, all vowels and open sky. \"Your fire-cores for our aurora-crystals. The exchange rate remains—\"\n\nThe berg shuddered. Not the walls—the berg itself, as if something impossibly large had rolled over in its sleep. Dust that had been frozen for generations broke free from the ceiling. One of Selka's crystal-bearers dropped their spire; it shattered with a sound like breaking starlight.\n\nNyla's star-fragments clicked. She counted them without thinking: one-two-three-four-five. Five secrets. Five things she'd traded her soul to learn. The fifth one was this: the orcas weren't raiding for resources anymore. They were raiding for position. They knew something was coming.\n\n\"The accord holds,\" Nyla agreed, because there were things you said when councils met, words that kept the machinery of civilization grinding forward even when the ground beneath it started to crack. \"But we need to discuss the lower galleries. The pressure-ice is behaving—\"\n\n\"The lower galleries are Nightshelf concern.\" Selka's tone could have frozen water that was already ice. \"Unless you're requesting Aurora Stack intervention in your territorial—\"\n\n\"I'm requesting,\" Nyla said quietly, \"that you listen to what the berg is telling us.\"\n\nSelka listened. They all did, in the silence that followed. The berg was singing—a low frequency hum that vibrated through bone and flipper, through the ancient ice, through the spaces where memory lived. It was a song the Nightshelf had heard before, in the oldest records, in the deepest caves where their ancestors had first learned to mine fire from stone.\n\nIt was the sound of something waking up.\n\nThe raid came three days later, during the shift-change when the galleries were fullest. The orcas breached through a thermal vent in the western shelf—a route that shouldn't have existed, that the Star Ice Spiral charts said was solid ice for another season at least. They came up through the floor in a spray of superheated water and blood-hunger, and the Nightshelf died before they could reach their fire-cores.\n\nNyla was in her chamber when the screams started. She didn't run toward them. She'd learned long ago that leaders who ran toward screams usually just became additional screams. Instead, she moved to her vault—the small carved space where she kept the things that couldn't be traded, couldn't be stolen, couldn't be explained to councils or recorded in logs.\n\nThe Nova Sphere sat on its pedestal, wrapped in preservation-ice that never melted. Comet-Office law forbade its use in populated tunnels. Arcade Euroum had locked it away after the incident that killed two hundred. Nyla had stolen it anyway, because she'd seen what orcas did to captured Nightshelf, and she'd decided some laws were worth breaking.\n\nHer flippers were steady as she lifted it. The surface burned cold—the particular cold of fire that had been frozen at the moment of its hottest burning, trapped in ice that remembered what it used to be. She could feel the weight of it, not in mass but in consequence. Every choice that had led here. Every secret traded. Every name she'd promised to forget.\n\nThe orcas had reached the second gallery by the time she arrived. She could see them through the crowd of fleeing Nightshelf—massive shapes moving with the fluid grace of apex predators, their teeth red with fresh kill, their eyes empty of everything except hunger and faith. They were singing. That was the worst part. They were singing their dead god's name, calling to something in the deep that they believed would answer.\n\nNyla raised the Nova Sphere. \"Shimmer Floe Ascend,\" she said, and her voice carried the weight of formal invocation, the particular cadence that turned words into working. The sphere flared in her flippers—cold fire spreading out in a dome that swallowed everything within thirty meters. The light didn't distinguish. That's what the reports had said after Arcade Euroum. The light didn't distinguish between ally and enemy, between Nightshelf and orca, between the penguins you meant to save and the ones who just happened to be standing too close.\n\nThe dome held. Inside it, everything stopped. The orcas froze mid-lunge, their jaws open on screams that would never finish. The Nightshelf froze mid-flight, their flippers reaching for tunnels they'd never reach. And Nyla stood at the center of it all, holding the sphere that had saved them, watching the faces of her people locked in ice that might never thaw.\n\nAurdioriia found her there six hours later, when the sphere finally dimmed and the dome collapsed. The orcas were dead—frozen solid, their blood crystallized in their veins. Twenty-three Nightshelf were dead too. Frozen in the same ice, killed by the same light that had saved everyone else.\n\n\"You broke Comet-Office law,\" Aurdioriia said. She wasn't accusing. Just stating fact.\n\n\"Yes.\" Nyla's flippers wouldn't stop shaking. She set down the sphere. It clicked against the ice with the same sound her star-fragments made. One-two-three-four-five. Five secrets. She'd need a sixth fragment now, to remember this.\n\n\"The Midnight Claws will want to know why you had it.\"\n\n\"Let them ask.\"\n\nThey did ask, later, in the emergency council that assembled in Nyla's own chamber because the main galleries were still being cleared of bodies. The Midnight Claws, Loam's auditors, Shade's Ring representatives—everyone who had a stake in what the Nightshelf would do next. High-Beak Auditor Selka came too, because the Aurora Stack needed to know if their trade partners were about to collapse into civil war.\n\n\"The orcas breached through impossible routes,\" Nyla said. She stood in her carved alcove, the one that would someday be empty because no one else could breathe there. \"The Star Ice Spiral charts were wrong. The pressure-ice is shifting. The berg itself is changing.\"\n\n\"The berg doesn't change.\" This from Defpoloenae, one of the Midnight Claws' senior members. \"The berg is eternal.\"\n\n\"The berg is waking up.\" Nyla touched the wall behind her, pressed her flipper to ice that pulsed with something older than memory. \"And when it fully wakes, the orcas will be the least of our problems.\"\n\nThe silence that followed was the kind that precedes either violence or understanding. Selka broke it, her surface-dweller voice strange in these deep halls. \"What are you proposing?\"\n\n\"An expedition.\" Nyla's star-fragments clicked. \"To the lowest shelf. To the places where the ice remembers the beginning. We need to know what we're living on. What we've always been living on.\"\n\n\"That's heresy,\" someone said. Maybe Defpoloenae. Maybe someone else. In the dark, with the berg humming its waking song, it was hard to tell voices apart.\n\n\"That's survival,\" Nyla corrected. \"The orcas know something we don't. They're positioning themselves for something. Their raids aren't random anymore—they're testing us, measuring our response time, learning our defenses. They're preparing.\"\n\n\"For what?\"\n\nNyla looked at Selka. At Aurdioriia. At the assembled representatives of every faction that kept the Nightshelf alive. \"For when their god wakes up,\" she said. \"And takes back what it thinks belongs to it.\"\n\nThe council voted. Not unanimously—nothing in the Nightshelf ever was—but with enough weight to make it real. An expedition to the deepest shelf. A team of fire-keepers and Star Ice Spiral readers, of Midnight Claws scouts and Shade's Ring navigators. They would go down into the places where the berg's memory was strongest, where the ice still held impressions of whatever came before. They would learn what they were living on.\n\nNyla would lead it. Of course she would. That's what it meant to be Shadow-Broker—to carry the secrets no one else wanted, to make the trades no one else could stomach, to go into the dark and come back changed.\n\nIf she came back at all.\n\nThe night before they descended, Aurdioriia brought her a fire-core. Not a working one—a dead core, its flame long since guttered, its heat just memory. \"For light,\" she said. \"The aurora doesn't reach that deep.\"\n\nNyla took it. The core was warm in her flippers, warmer than it should be for something dead. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"Don't thank me.\" Aurdioriia turned to leave, then stopped. \"The twenty-three who died in the dome. Their families are asking questions.\"\n\n\"Let them ask.\"\n\n\"Nyla—\"\n\n\"I killed them.\" The words came out flat, factual. \"I knew the dome wouldn't distinguish. I activated it anyway. That's the trade I made. Twenty-three lives for two hundred. Their families deserve to know that.\"\n\nAurdioriia was quiet for a long moment. Then: \"Some of us are grateful. That you made that trade. That you were willing to.\"\n\n\"Gratitude doesn't bring them back.\"\n\n\"No,\" Aurdioriia agreed. \"But it might bring you back. Remember that, in the deep. Remember that some of us need you to come home.\"\n\nShe left. Nyla stood alone in her chamber, holding a dead fire-core, listening to the berg sing its waking song. Her star-fragments clicked in the silence: one-two-three-four-five. Five secrets traded. Five pieces of her soul given up for knowledge.\n\nSoon, she thought, there would be a sixth. The ice remembers everything. And tomorrow, she would go down into its deepest memory and learn what it had been trying to forget.\n\nThe berg shuddered again. Somewhere in the frozen sea, something vast rolled over. Somewhere in the deep, dead gods dreamed of waking.\n\nAnd in Sheen Liofio, in the tunnels where fire met ice and neither won, the Nightshelf prepared for the descent that would define them—or end them.\n\nThe star-fragments clicked. The berg sang. The expedition would leave at dawn."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3903,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2933,"service_tier":"standard"}}
