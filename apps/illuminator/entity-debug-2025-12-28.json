During The Great Thaw, when the berg's stability wavered and orca raids grew bold, Nyla's methods kept Nightfall Shelf functioning, though few could say exactly how. She practiced the Ravager's arts in ways she never explained, and the colony learned not to ask.

Where other orcas learned to shatter ice or splinter wood, Thir learned to read the stress-lines in bone itself, to understand where pressure would cascade into collapse. He was taught by Ravager Run in the old ways, but it was Thuimk'nukgung—the deeper magic of transformation and breaking—that truly shaped him. During The Great Thaw, when the Berg's ice grew unstable and the colonies' defenses wavered, Thir led raids that penguins still recount in hushed tones: not as tales of heroic defense, but as reckonings with a predator who understood his prey's architecture better than they understood themselves. He moved with the deliberate weight of something that had never needed to rush, never needed to prove itself. Other orcas followed him because he succeeded. The penguins feared him because he made it look inevitable.\\n\\nGenerate 2-4 visual traits that ADD to the thesis - features it didn't cover.\"}]}",

She rose to prominence in the chaos of the Great Thaw by recognizing what others missed: that the scattered penguin colonies could survive not through hoarding or conquest, but through structured exchange. Where Selka taught her to read ledgers with precision, Iae-nuk learned to read penguins—their fears, their surpluses, the small trades that could bind communities together. She founded the Icebound Exchange on this principle, and it became the sinew connecting Aurora Stack to the wider Berg. Her faith in the Covenant Of Transmuting informs her belief that resources and knowledge, like matter itself, are meant to flow and transform. Those who've negotiated with her speak of her directness: she speaks in short sentences, commits to what she says, and expects the same from others. In an age of Orca raids and unpredictable ice, she has become something rarer than a hero—she has become reliable.\\n\\nGenerate 2-4 visual traits that ADD to the thesis - features it didn't cover.\"}]}",

Within the Womeissoak Covenant, she built something rare on the Berg: trust that crossed the old territorial lines.
