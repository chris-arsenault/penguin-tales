  "content": "The ice spoke before the orcas did.\n\nAt The Fissured Smelt~, three days before the war, the settling pools began to freeze in patterns that shouldn't exist—spirals within spirals, recursive and geometric, the kind of ice that remembered things older than the berg itself. The Guild workers pulled their flippers back from the water and somebody laughed, nervous, saying it was just the cold snap. But the forges ran at the same temperature they'd run for centuries, and the mineral-water kept its copper-blood warmth, and the ice kept forming anyway.\n\nKeeper Hollows arrived at dusk with the chart wrapped against his chest.\n\nHe'd been surface-side for two weeks—unheard of for a Nightshelf who hadn't seen sky in living memory—and the aurora had bleached his feathers to corpse-color. His left flipper shook. His right gripped the oilcloth bundle like it was the last fire in the world. The Guild workers knew him by reputation: the survivor, the tunnel-mad, the one who heard knocking from below the ice-locks and wouldn't say what it wanted. They'd stopped asking years ago.\n\nHe stood at the eastern wall where Scar☽ Sanctcaetiata's corruption had burned through, where the ice still carried the blackness despite Veil-render Seciae~'s scrubbing. Put his trembling flipper against it. The warmth beneath the ice answered his touch with a sensation like recognition.\n\n\"They're coming for the deep routes,\" Hollows said to no one in particular. \"The Singers. They know.\"\n\nA worker—young, still had hope in his voice—asked how he could possibly know that.\n\nHollows unwrapped the chart. Water-damage had warped it into permanent waves; the ink bled in haloes. But the lower sections, the ones with symbols that pulled at peripheral vision, those were clear enough. \"Because the chart told them. Because I was stupid enough to look at it under aurora-light while standing at The Dawn Terrace, and something was watching through the ice.\"\n\nThe young worker backed away. The older ones stayed; they'd survived too much to be spooked by prophecy.\n\n\"What did they see?\" Totatirus~ Domina's voice, from the upper cavern. She descended the carved steps with the deliberation of someone who'd already made her choice but wanted you to think you still had one. Her token—the fire-core carved into a closed flipper—hung above the main forge, untouched. She didn't look at it.\n\nHollows pressed the chart flat against the blackened wall. The geometric symbols seemed to sink into the corruption-scarred ice; for a moment both chart and wall glowed with that wrong light. \"Routes to the god-corpse. Or what they think is the god-corpse. Might just be the berg's deep memory. Might be worse.\"\n\n\"And if the Wake-Singers breach the Smelt to reach these routes?\"\n\n\"Then they flood the tunnels with blood-magic and ritual drowning until they wake something that shouldn't wake.\" Hollows's voice cracked. \"Or they don't wake anything, and they kill us for the fire anyway because we're in their way.\"\n\nThe Smelt's workers passed looks between them—the kind of looks people share when they already know they're dead but haven't picked their method yet. One of them, scarred from thirty years of steam-scalding, touched Totatirus~'s fire-core token as she passed. A prayer or a farewell.\n\nThe ice continued forming in spirals. The knocking from below the locks grew louder.\n\n---\n\nThe Shadow Parliament convened in the old aquifer chamber where the ice sang in three frequencies and nobody trusted the walls enough to speak plainly. Eleven guild-masters in a circle, their breath frosting white, their tokens hung on chains that clicked when they moved. Hollows sat outside the circle—not guild, not quite outlaw, just the one who knew things nobody wanted to know.\n\nTotatirus~ Domina spoke first; protocol demanded it. \"The Wake-Singers have been sighted at The Dawn Terrace. Four scouts, armed with bone-headdresses and blood-crystals. They're mapping something.\"\n\n\"They've mapped the Terrace before,\" Umbralsom☽ the Depthseer countered. \"During the Faction Wars, when it was contested ground. They lost it then. They'll lose it again.\"\n\n\"They had numbers then.\" This from ☽'profundix the Recorder, who kept the ice-memories sealed in the deep archives. \"Now they have desperation. The god won't wake on prayers alone. They need something else.\"\n\nHollows laughed—bitter, not funny. \"They need the routes my chart shows. The ones that go below the Smelt, below the known depths, to the place where the berg's ice stops remembering penguin things and starts remembering whatever was here before.\"\n\nSilence. The kind that meant everyone was calculating how much truth to admit.\n\n☽'niraen 'born broke it. \"The Medallion Of Pathway is responding. Three nights running, it's glowed without aurora-light. The Lector died trying to understand what it was showing her. Maybe it's showing them, too.\"\n\n\"Then we seal the Smelt.\" Totatirus~ said it flat, like she was ordering lunch. \"Collapse the upper galleries, flood the approach tunnels, make the whole site worthless.\"\n\n\"And lose our only forge-grade ore?\" Umbralsom☽'s feathers bristled. \"The Aurora Stack already controls the surface crystals. We give up the Smelt, we're begging them for fire-cores at whatever price they name.\"\n\n\"Better than letting the Singers drown us in their ritual madness.\"\n\nThe debate spiraled—strategies, contingencies, how many workers could evacuate, whether the Aurora Stack would honor the Flipper Accord if the Nightshelf showed weakness. Hollows listened and didn't listen. He'd heard councils before. They always ended the same way: too late, too cautious, too many corpses proving everybody wrong.\n\nHe stood. Protocol violation; guild-masters looked at him like he'd spat on their tokens.\n\n\"The chart isn't just a map,\" Hollows said. His left flipper wouldn't stop shaking. \"It's a... call. I don't know what else to name it. Every time I open it, something answers. And whatever's answering, the Singers can hear it too. You fortify the Smelt, they'll just breach from below. You seal it, they'll crack it open. You station warriors, they'll sacrifice them. They've been offering up penguins for years thinking it'll wake their god.\" He pulled the chart out, let them see the geometric madness of its lower sections. \"What if they're right? What if all they needed was the right location?\"\n\n☽'profundix moved forward. She practiced ☽'glacial Crystalline~ Spiral—could seal moments into ice, trap heartbeats and last words in frozen recursion. Her own memories were already bleeding together; she'd sealed too many battles, too many deaths. \"Let me see it.\"\n\nShe pressed her flipper against the chart where the jagged scar-line divided professional notation from that other thing. The room's temperature dropped. Frost spread from her touch in fractal patterns.\n\n\"It's not a call,\" she said quietly. \"It's a memory answering. The berg remembering itself from before the ice learned to forget.\" She looked up, eyes haunted. \"And yes. The Singers heard it. They're already moving.\"\n\nThe council voted to fortify The Fissured Smelt~. Three voted to seal it. Eight voted to make a stand. Nobody voted for what Hollows wanted: to burn the chart, collapse the deep routes, and live with less rather than risk waking what the ice kept buried.\n\nBut democracy is just choosing how you die together.\n\n---\n\nThe Wake-Singers came through the steam.\n\nThey didn't breach the main entrance; they'd learned subtlety after the Faction Wars hollowed their strongholds. Instead they came through the mineral-water channels, rising from pools that shouldn't connect to the outside sea, their headdresses carved from ancestor-bone and their voices pitched at frequencies that made the workers' hearts skip. Scar-Matriarch Keth'nal led them, old enough to remember when orcas owned the surface and penguins hid in snow-holes. She sang in the old way—not words but pressure-changes that bypassed language and spoke directly to the part of the brain that knew drowning.\n\nThe Guild warriors met them at the settling pools. Twenty Nightshelf fighters with fire-core weapons and tunnel-fighting expertise against seven orcas who'd grown fat on penguin blood and lean on failure. It should have been slaughter.\n\nIt was, but not the expected direction.\n\nVel'keth the Younger led the assault—efficient, brutal, singing the liturgy of the drowned god while ripping through defenders with teeth that had been ritual-scarred and blessed. Two Nightshelf warriors died before anyone landed a hit. Three more died trying to drag the first bodies back. The orcas weren't trying to win; they were trying to reach something.\n\nHollows saw it from the upper gallery where Totatirus~ had stationed him—far from the fighting, close to the chart. \"They're heading for the eastern wall,\" he shouted down. \"The corruption scar. Where the ice remembers wrong.\"\n\n☽'profundix was already there, hands pressed against ice, sealing moments into frozen recursion: the first warrior's death, the look on his face when he realized the song was in his skull; Vel'keth's eyes when the blood-ritual activated and his body stopped being entirely mammal. She was crying. The magic cost her own memories to fuel it—every moment sealed was a moment of her own life blurred—but the chronicle had to survive.\n\nTotatirus~ descended with the kind of calm that meant she'd already written herself off. She carried a fire-core hammer with a cracked head—the Smelt's oldest tool, the one they used to first break through to the volcanic veins centuries ago. \"Get Hollows out,\" she said to no one, to everyone. \"Get the chart deeper. If they breach to the routes below, we lose everything.\"\n\n\"You'll die here.\"\n\n\"Someone has to.\" She smiled, bitter and fond. \"I've had a good run. Still owe you that fire-tea, Profundix. You'll have to drink my cup for me.\"\n\nThe orcas reached the eastern wall. Keth'nal pressed her scarred face against the corruption-mark and sang something that wasn't meant for penguin hearing—older than language, deeper than meaning. The ice answered. Cracks spread in those spiral patterns, recursive and geometric, the same patterns Hollows's chart showed in its lowest sections.\n\nSomething vast moved beneath them. Not waking. Not yet. But aware, suddenly, that it had been called.\n\nTotatirus~ swung the hammer. The fire-core blazed; the impact shattered three of Keth'nal's teeth and drove her back into the settling pool. The other Singers surged forward. Totatirus~ met them standing, the way Guild-masters stand when they've run out of cleverness and have only defiance left.\n\nHollows ran. Not because he wanted to; because ☽'profundix grabbed his collar and hauled him up the carved steps while the sounds of slaughter echoed behind them. His left flipper shook so badly he could barely grip the chart. His right wouldn't let go.\n\n\"She's buying us time,\" Profundix gasped. \"Don't waste it on guilt.\"\n\nThey made it to the upper cavern as the eastern wall finally gave way—not collapsed but *opened*, the ice remembering that it had been a passage once, long before penguins carved these tunnels, when something else lived in the berg's depths. The knocking from below the ice-locks turned into something else: a rhythm that matched no mining code but felt, horribly, like language.\n\nBehind them, Totatirus~ Domina died in half a sentence, her words cut off as Vel'keth's jaws closed and the fire-core hammer fell silent.\n\n☽'profundix pressed her flippers against the nearest wall and sealed it all: Totatirus~'s last stand, the wall's opening, the moment the vast thing below noticed the breach. Her eyes bled. The magic was taking too much; she was sealing her own life alongside the history.\n\n\"Go,\" she whispered. \"Take the chart deeper. I'll hold this memory.\"\n\n\"You'll die.\"\n\n\"I'm already dying. Every moment I seal takes a moment of mine.\" She smiled with her eyes closed. \"But the ice will remember true. Future generations will know what it cost. Now *go*.\"\n\nHollows went. The chart burned cold against his chest. Behind him, ☽'profundix the Recorder sealed her own death into ice, creating the chronicle that would become legend—the moment The Fissured Smelt~ became contested ground, the moment war started, the moment something vast and old noticed the penguins again.\n\nThe Wake-Singers didn't pursue. They'd found what they came for: the route down, the path to whatever the god-corpse was, the answer to decades of ritual and blood.\n\nThe cost didn't matter. It never had.\n\n---\n\nThe Fissured Smelt~ still bleeds heat, but nobody mines there anymore.\n\nThe Guild sealed the upper galleries after retrieving what bodies they could. Totatirus~ Domina's fire-core token remains above the abandoned forge; locals say if you stand there at dusk, you can still smell copper-blood and hear the settling pools hiss. Nobody sits in her carved seat. Nobody jokes about her anymore, the way they used to—affectionate complaints about her micromanagement, her inability to delegate, how she'd check your work three times and still worry.\n\nThe Wake-Singers never returned to the surface. They went down through the corruption-breach, following whatever the chart's geometric symbols promised. Some say they found the god-corpse. Some say they found only more ice and old darkness. Some say they're still down there, singing to something that will never wake, too committed to their faith to climb back up and admit failure.\n\nKeeper Hollows survived. The Midnight Claws gave him a formal pardon—not because he'd done anything heroic, but because he'd been right, and being right about disasters counts for something in Nightshelf culture. He keeps the chart still, wrapped in Totatirus~'s oilcloth now, marked with her scent. He won't burn it. Won't trade it. Won't explain why.\n\nAt The Dawn Terrace, the Medallion Of Pathway glows without aurora-light on the anniversary of the breach. The pattern matches nothing on The Berg—or everything, depending on who's looking. The Aurora Stack enshrined it under Stillness-Bound law; nobody touches it. Not because they're forbidden. Because it remembers, and some memories are meant to stay frozen.\n\nThe ice at The Fissured Smelt~'s eastern wall still holds ☽'profundix's sealed moments. If you press your flipper against it, you can feel her dying—the way her memories bled together, how she sealed her own heartbeat alongside Totatirus~'s last swing, the sensation of sealing history while becoming history. The Nightshelf built a small shrine there: two cups, never filled, sitting on a ledge where the steam rises.\n\nThe war hasn't ended because it never really began—just revealed itself, the way ice reveals old corruption when the light hits right. The Wake-Singers took the deep routes. The Nightshelf fortified what remained. The Aurora Stack watches from their spires, waiting to see which colony falls first.\n\nAnd below, in the dark beneath the Smelt, something vast continues its almost-waking. The knocking has stopped. Now there's only pressure—the sensation of attention, of something immense and patient measuring the distance between sleep and waking, between old memory and new action.\n\nThe spiral patterns still form in the settling pools on cold nights. The ice still remembers. And Keeper Hollows still camps at the Glow-Fissure, his left flipper shaking, his right gripping things too hard, listening for the sound that everyone else pretends not to hear:\n\nThe rhythm below the ice-locks. Not knocking anymore.\n\nCounting.",

The Aurora Stack watches from their spires, waiting to see which colony falls first.\n\nAnd below, in the dark beneath the Smelt, something vast continues its almost-waking. The knocking has stopped. Now there's only pressure—the sensation of attention, of something immense and patient measuring the distance between sleep and waking, between old memory and new action.\n\nThe spiral patterns still form in the settling pools on cold nights. The ice still remembers. And Keeper Hollows still camps at the Glow-Fissure, his left flipper shaking, his right gripping things too hard, listening for the sound that everyone else pretends not to hear:\n\nThe rhythm below the ice-locks. Not knocking anymore.\n\nCounting.",

The Wake-Singers, seeking to awaken their god, breach the forge through the corruption-scarred eastern wall, leading to a desperate stand where Guild-master Totatirus~ Domina and the Recorder ☽'profundix sacrifice themselves to seal the moment into history. Though the Singers descend into the deep routes and the breach is sealed, something vast stirs beneath the ice—no longer knocking, but counting—leaving the war between colonies unresolved and the threat of awakening ever present.",

    "sceneDescription": "A fractured, layered montage composition dominated by swirling ice-spiral patterns that recursively frame overlapping scenes of catastrophe and sacrifice. In the foreground, Keeper Hollows's trembling left flipper presses against a corruption-scarred ice wall (The Fissured Smelt~'s eastern breach), his feathers corpse-pale and backlit by aurora-glow, the Hollows Chart wrapped against his chest with visible water-damage and bleeding ink symbols. Behind him in mid-ground, Totatirus~ Domina stands defiant with the cracked fire-core hammer raised, her silhouette framed by the moment of the wall's opening—geometric ice-cracks spreading like veins. To the left, ☽'profundix the Recorder's form dissolves into crystalline recursion as she seals moments into ice, her eyes bleeding, her body becoming translucent and memory-like. In the background, The Dawn Terrace's architecture rises through mist, with the Medallion Of Pathway glowing with unnatural light, and the shadowed forms of Wake-Singers (bone-headdresses visible) descending into darkness below. The entire composition is overlaid with ☽'glacial Crystalline~ Spiral patterns—spirals within spirals, recursive and geometric—that blur the boundaries between scenes and suggest the ice remembering itself. Lighting shifts from copper-blood forge-warmth in the lower sections to cold aurora-blue in the upper, with deep shadows suggesting the vast presence moving beneath. The mood is elegiac and ominous: sacrifice meeting inevitability, the moment history becomes chronicle, beauty and horror indistinguishable in frozen recursion.",
