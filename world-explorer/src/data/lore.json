Glintbeak publicly blamed Draen for endangering colony resources, while Draen accused the Radicals of hoarding knowledge about the fissure's true nature instead of sharing it with Frost Guard researchers. | Stakes: Draen's obsession with fissure power threatens cross-colony stability; Glintbeak's radical faction sees Draen as a symbol of the old guard's recklessness. If Draen's methods prove catastrophic, it could justify the Radicals' push to restrict fissure access entirely—or worse, weaponize it. | Perception: Nightfall Shelf views Draen as a hero pushing boundaries; The Midnight Claws Radicals paint him as a danger to both colonies. Frost Guard remains officially neutral but quietly concerned. Deep Singers, if aware, see both as missing the fissure's deeper significance.",

      "text": "The Starfall Collapse: Aurora Stack's expedition to Starfall Reach discovers a cache of pre-penguin artifacts within a destabilizing Glow-Fissure, but the site collapses before full retrieval. Stack claims the artifacts belong to Aurora colony by right of discovery, while Nightfall Shelf—backed by The Icebound Exchange—asserts that Fissure rights are communal under Frost Guard doctrine. Simultaneously, krill populations mysteriously vanish from traditional Aurora fishing territories, forcing Aurora to encroach on Nightfall waters. The Icebound Exchange exploits the crisis by hoarding melting ice coins and demanding exorbitant prices for emergency supplies. When Aurora's desperate expedition team fails to return from a secondary Starfall attempt, cultural blame fractures the fragile trade agreement. Resource scarcity and artifact control collide as both colonies mobilize armed contingents, shattering the Great Thaw's cooperative period and igniting competing claims that splinter into factional warfare.",
