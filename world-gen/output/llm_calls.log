CRITICAL: Use each entity's "relationships" field to inform descriptions.
If an NPC has "resident_of": ["Colony X"], mention Colony X in their description.
If they have "member_of": ["Faction Y"], reference the Faction Y faction.
Descriptions must be consistent with actual relationships shown above.

CATALYST AWARENESS: Some entities have agency and trigger events.
If entity.catalyst.eventsTriggered > 5, describe them as influential/impactful.
If entity.catalyst.actionDomains includes specific domains, reflect that in their description.
Action domains: political: governance, alliances, territorial claims; military: warfare, raids, defense, sieges; economic: trade, resource control, blockades; magical: ice magic manipulation, mystical forces; technological: innovation, tool development, weaponization; environmental: natural forces, ice drift, krill migration; cultural: ideology spread, conversion, inspiration; conflict_escalation: war intensification, faction recruitment; disaster_spread: catastrophe expansion, corruption spreading
Use catalyst.influence to determine tone (high influence = respected/feared/powerful).

Tone guidance: Aurora Stack: practical, trade-focused, concise; Nightfall Shelf: poetic, mysterious, innovative
Naming patterns: Two-part names: ice name (birth) + earned name (First Dive deed); Aurora Stack names are shorter and practical; Nightfall Shelf names are more poetic or descriptive
Do not invent new mechanics; stay within canon: Two main colonies with trade and communication; Ice magic exists but has costs; Pre-penguin artifacts are in the berg; Glow-Fissure is recent; Frost Guard neutrality, Deep Singers knowledge.
Keep the existing names unchanged - only enrich descriptions.
IMPORTANT: Keep each description under 50 words. Be concise and evocative.
Return JSON array only.

CRITICAL: Use each entity's "relationships" field to inform descriptions.
If an NPC has "resident_of": ["Colony X"], mention Colony X in their description.

Descriptions must be consistent with actual relationships shown above.

CATALYST AWARENESS: Some entities have agency and trigger events.
If entity.catalyst.eventsTriggered > 5, describe them as influential/impactful.
If entity.catalyst.actionDomains includes specific domains, reflect that in their description.
Action domains: political: governance, alliances, territorial claims; military: warfare, raids, defense, sieges; economic: trade, resource control, blockades; magical: ice magic manipulation, mystical forces; technological: innovation, tool development, weaponization; environmental: natural forces, ice drift, krill migration; cultural: ideology spread, conversion, inspiration; conflict_escalation: war intensification, faction recruitment; disaster_spread: catastrophe expansion, corruption spreading
Use catalyst.influence to determine tone (high influence = respected/feared/powerful).

Tone guidance: Aurora Stack: practical, trade-focused, concise; Nightfall Shelf: poetic, mysterious, innovative
Naming patterns: Two-part names: ice name (birth) + earned name (First Dive deed); Aurora Stack names are shorter and practical; Nightfall Shelf names are more poetic or descriptive
Do not invent new mechanics; stay within canon: Two main colonies with trade and communication; Ice magic exists but has costs; Pre-penguin artifacts are in the berg; Glow-Fissure is recent; Frost Guard neutrality, Deep Singers knowledge.
You MUST change the placeholder names; do not repeat the provided placeholder.
IMPORTANT: Keep each description under 50 words. Be concise and evocative.

CATALYST AWARENESS: Some entities have agency and trigger events.
If entity.catalyst.eventsTriggered > 5, describe them as influential/impactful.
If entity.catalyst.actionDomains includes specific domains, reflect that in their description.
Action domains: political: governance, alliances, territorial claims; military: warfare, raids, defense, sieges; economic: trade, resource control, blockades; magical: ice magic manipulation, mystical forces; technological: innovation, tool development, weaponization; environmental: natural forces, ice drift, krill migration; cultural: ideology spread, conversion, inspiration; conflict_escalation: war intensification, faction recruitment; disaster_spread: catastrophe expansion, corruption spreading
Use catalyst.influence to determine tone (high influence = respected/feared/powerful).

Tone guidance: Aurora Stack: practical, trade-focused, concise; Nightfall Shelf: poetic, mysterious, innovative
Naming patterns: Two-part names: ice name (birth) + earned name (First Dive deed); Aurora Stack names are shorter and practical; Nightfall Shelf names are more poetic or descriptive
Do not invent new mechanics; stay within canon: Two main colonies with trade and communication; Ice magic exists but has costs; Pre-penguin artifacts are in the berg; Glow-Fissure is recent; Frost Guard neutrality, Deep Singers knowledge.

CATALYST AWARENESS: Some entities have agency and trigger events.
If entity.catalyst.eventsTriggered > 5, describe them as influential/impactful.
If entity.catalyst.actionDomains includes specific domains, reflect that in their description.
Action domains: political: governance, alliances, territorial claims; military: warfare, raids, defense, sieges; economic: trade, resource control, blockades; magical: ice magic manipulation, mystical forces; technological: innovation, tool development, weaponization; environmental: natural forces, ice drift, krill migration; cultural: ideology spread, conversion, inspiration; conflict_escalation: war intensification, faction recruitment; disaster_spread: catastrophe expansion, corruption spreading
Use catalyst.influence to determine tone (high influence = respected/feared/powerful).

Tone guidance: Aurora Stack: practical, trade-focused, concise; Nightfall Shelf: poetic, mysterious, innovative
Naming patterns: Two-part names: ice name (birth) + earned name (First Dive deed); Aurora Stack names are shorter and practical; Nightfall Shelf names are more poetic or descriptive
Do not invent new mechanics; stay within canon: Two main colonies with trade and communication; Ice magic exists but has costs; Pre-penguin artifacts are in the berg; Glow-Fissure is recent; Frost Guard neutrality, Deep Singers knowledge.
You MUST change the placeholder names; do not repeat the provided placeholder.
IMPORTANT: Keep each description under 50 words. Be concise and evocative.

CRITICAL: Use each entity's "relationships" field to inform descriptions.
If an NPC has "resident_of": ["Colony X"], mention Colony X in their description.
If they have "member_of": ["Faction Y"], reference the Faction Y faction.
Descriptions must be consistent with actual relationships shown above.

CATALYST AWARENESS: Some entities have agency and trigger events.
If entity.catalyst.eventsTriggered > 5, describe them as influential/impactful.
If entity.catalyst.actionDomains includes specific domains, reflect that in their description.
Action domains: political: governance, alliances, territorial claims; military: warfare, raids, defense, sieges; economic: trade, resource control, blockades; magical: ice magic manipulation, mystical forces; technological: innovation, tool development, weaponization; environmental: natural forces, ice drift, krill migration; cultural: ideology spread, conversion, inspiration; conflict_escalation: war intensification, faction recruitment; disaster_spread: catastrophe expansion, corruption spreading
Use catalyst.influence to determine tone (high influence = respected/feared/powerful).

Tone guidance: Aurora Stack: practical, trade-focused, concise; Nightfall Shelf: poetic, mysterious, innovative
Naming patterns: Two-part names: ice name (birth) + earned name (First Dive deed); Aurora Stack names are shorter and practical; Nightfall Shelf names are more poetic or descriptive
Do not invent new mechanics; stay within canon: Two main colonies with trade and communication; Ice magic exists but has costs; Pre-penguin artifacts are in the berg; Glow-Fissure is recent; Frost Guard neutrality, Deep Singers knowledge.
You MUST change the placeholder names; do not repeat the provided placeholder.
IMPORTANT: Keep each description under 50 words. Be concise and evocative.

If an NPC has "resident_of": ["Colony X"], mention Colony X in their description.
If they have "member_of": ["Faction Y"], reference the Faction Y faction.
Descriptions must be consistent with actual relationships shown above.

CATALYST AWARENESS: Some entities have agency and trigger events.
If entity.catalyst.eventsTriggered > 5, describe them as influential/impactful.
If entity.catalyst.actionDomains includes specific domains, reflect that in their description.
Action domains: political: governance, alliances, territorial claims; military: warfare, raids, defense, sieges; economic: trade, resource control, blockades; magical: ice magic manipulation, mystical forces; technological: innovation, tool development, weaponization; environmental: natural forces, ice drift, krill migration; cultural: ideology spread, conversion, inspiration; conflict_escalation: war intensification, faction recruitment; disaster_spread: catastrophe expansion, corruption spreading
Use catalyst.influence to determine tone (high influence = respected/feared/powerful).

Tone guidance: Aurora Stack: practical, trade-focused, concise; Nightfall Shelf: poetic, mysterious, innovative
Naming patterns: Two-part names: ice name (birth) + earned name (First Dive deed); Aurora Stack names are shorter and practical; Nightfall Shelf names are more poetic or descriptive
Do not invent new mechanics; stay within canon: Two main colonies with trade and communication; Ice magic exists but has costs; Pre-penguin artifacts are in the berg; Glow-Fissure is recent; Frost Guard neutrality, Deep Singers knowledge.
You MUST change the placeholder names; do not repeat the provided placeholder.
IMPORTANT: Keep each description under 50 words. Be concise and evocative.

CATALYST AWARENESS: Some entities have agency and trigger events.
If entity.catalyst.eventsTriggered > 5, describe them as influential/impactful.
If entity.catalyst.actionDomains includes specific domains, reflect that in their description.
Action domains: political: governance, alliances, territorial claims; military: warfare, raids, defense, sieges; economic: trade, resource control, blockades; magical: ice magic manipulation, mystical forces; technological: innovation, tool development, weaponization; environmental: natural forces, ice drift, krill migration; cultural: ideology spread, conversion, inspiration; conflict_escalation: war intensification, faction recruitment; disaster_spread: catastrophe expansion, corruption spreading
Use catalyst.influence to determine tone (high influence = respected/feared/powerful).

Tone guidance: Aurora Stack: practical, trade-focused, concise; Nightfall Shelf: poetic, mysterious, innovative
Naming patterns: Two-part names: ice name (birth) + earned name (First Dive deed); Aurora Stack names are shorter and practical; Nightfall Shelf names are more poetic or descriptive
Do not invent new mechanics; stay within canon: Two main colonies with trade and communication; Ice magic exists but has costs; Pre-penguin artifacts are in the berg; Glow-Fissure is recent; Frost Guard neutrality, Deep Singers knowledge.
You MUST change the placeholder names; do not repeat the provided placeholder.
IMPORTANT: Keep each description under 50 words. Be concise and evocative.

If an NPC has "resident_of": ["Colony X"], mention Colony X in their description.
If they have "member_of": ["Faction Y"], reference the Faction Y faction.
Descriptions must be consistent with actual relationships shown above.

CATALYST AWARENESS: Some entities have agency and trigger events.
If entity.catalyst.eventsTriggered > 5, describe them as influential/impactful.
If entity.catalyst.actionDomains includes specific domains, reflect that in their description.
Action domains: political: governance, alliances, territorial claims; military: warfare, raids, defense, sieges; economic: trade, resource control, blockades; magical: ice magic manipulation, mystical forces; technological: innovation, tool development, weaponization; environmental: natural forces, ice drift, krill migration; cultural: ideology spread, conversion, inspiration; conflict_escalation: war intensification, faction recruitment; disaster_spread: catastrophe expansion, corruption spreading
Use catalyst.influence to determine tone (high influence = respected/feared/powerful).

Tone guidance: Aurora Stack: practical, trade-focused, concise; Nightfall Shelf: poetic, mysterious, innovative
Naming patterns: Two-part names: ice name (birth) + earned name (First Dive deed); Aurora Stack names are shorter and practical; Nightfall Shelf names are more poetic or descriptive
Do not invent new mechanics; stay within canon: Two main colonies with trade and communication; Ice magic exists but has costs; Pre-penguin artifacts are in the berg; Glow-Fissure is recent; Frost Guard neutrality, Deep Singers knowledge.

Inscriptions remain visible in cold conditions but fade as warmth approaches, creating a natural expiration date for transactions. Requires regular maintenance with Slide Wax to prevent premature degradation.",
  "flavor": "As the Great Thaw progresses, our coins melt faster than ever. The Thermal Ledger ensures no trade is forgotten—the ice itself remembers what we cannot. When the warmth comes for an entry, so too comes settlement."

  "description": "An Old Flow technique allowing a solitary practitioner to access fragmented memories preserved within ancient ice layers of the berg. The caster enters deep meditation to synchronize their personal ice-resonance with pre-penguin artifact frequencies, retrieving visions of historical events or locations. Each use risks accumulating ice fever and requires 3+ hours of cold meditation in isolation. Information retrieved is often cryptic, filtered through the ice's own 'perception.'",
  "flavor": "The berg remembers what we forget. To touch those memories is to let the cold touch back—burning from within as the old ice speaks through frozen veins. The Frost Guard warns against overuse; the Deep Singers say some memories were meant to stay buried."

CRITICAL: Use each entity's "relationships" field to inform descriptions.
If an NPC has "resident_of": ["Colony X"], mention Colony X in their description.
If they have "member_of": ["Faction Y"], reference the Faction Y faction.
Descriptions must be consistent with actual relationships shown above.

CATALYST AWARENESS: Some entities have agency and trigger events.
If entity.catalyst.eventsTriggered > 5, describe them as influential/impactful.
If entity.catalyst.actionDomains includes specific domains, reflect that in their description.
Action domains: political: governance, alliances, territorial claims; military: warfare, raids, defense, sieges; economic: trade, resource control, blockades; magical: ice magic manipulation, mystical forces; technological: innovation, tool development, weaponization; environmental: natural forces, ice drift, krill migration; cultural: ideology spread, conversion, inspiration; conflict_escalation: war intensification, faction recruitment; disaster_spread: catastrophe expansion, corruption spreading
Use catalyst.influence to determine tone (high influence = respected/feared/powerful).

Tone guidance: Aurora Stack: practical, trade-focused, concise; Nightfall Shelf: poetic, mysterious, innovative
Naming patterns: Two-part names: ice name (birth) + earned name (First Dive deed); Aurora Stack names are shorter and practical; Nightfall Shelf names are more poetic or descriptive
Do not invent new mechanics; stay within canon: Two main colonies with trade and communication; Ice magic exists but has costs; Pre-penguin artifacts are in the berg; Glow-Fissure is recent; Frost Guard neutrality, Deep Singers knowledge.
Keep the existing names unchanged - only enrich descriptions.
IMPORTANT: Keep each description under 50 words. Be concise and evocative.
Return JSON array only.

CRITICAL: Use each entity's "relationships" field to inform descriptions.
If an NPC has "resident_of": ["Colony X"], mention Colony X in their description.
If they have "member_of": ["Faction Y"], reference the Faction Y faction.
Descriptions must be consistent with actual relationships shown above.

CATALYST AWARENESS: Some entities have agency and trigger events.
If entity.catalyst.eventsTriggered > 5, describe them as influential/impactful.
If entity.catalyst.actionDomains includes specific domains, reflect that in their description.
Action domains: political: governance, alliances, territorial claims; military: warfare, raids, defense, sieges; economic: trade, resource control, blockades; magical: ice magic manipulation, mystical forces; technological: innovation, tool development, weaponization; environmental: natural forces, ice drift, krill migration; cultural: ideology spread, conversion, inspiration; conflict_escalation: war intensification, faction recruitment; disaster_spread: catastrophe expansion, corruption spreading
Use catalyst.influence to determine tone (high influence = respected/feared/powerful).

Tone guidance: Aurora Stack: practical, trade-focused, concise; Nightfall Shelf: poetic, mysterious, innovative
Naming patterns: Two-part names: ice name (birth) + earned name (First Dive deed); Aurora Stack names are shorter and practical; Nightfall Shelf names are more poetic or descriptive
Do not invent new mechanics; stay within canon: Two main colonies with trade and communication; Ice magic exists but has costs; Pre-penguin artifacts are in the berg; Glow-Fissure is recent; Frost Guard neutrality, Deep Singers knowledge.
Keep the existing names unchanged - only enrich descriptions.
IMPORTANT: Keep each description under 50 words. Be concise and evocative.

You are a precise lore keeper. Maximum 50 words per description. Respond only with JSON when asked.

--- User Prompt ---
You are enriching a Super Penguin Colonies of Aurora Berg history simulation.
Lore highlights:
Aurora Stack: orderly terraces, trade banners, sunlit face | values: commerce, tradition, recorded history ; Nightfall Shelf: shadow-side ledges, bioluminescent ice, rope bridges | values: independence, innovation, ancestral memory ; Windward Ridge: watchtower settlement | values: scouting, weather watch ; The Middle Pools: neutral fishing grounds | values: neutrality, shared fishing ; Echo Hollow: abandoned, echoes of the past | values: mystery | Conflicts: Fissure rights and artifact control; Krill scarcity and fishing territory; Trade imbalance and melting ice coins; Lost expeditions near Starfall Reach | Tech: Technology is communal and reliable (harmonic harpoons, krill nets, ice augers); Glow Stones, Message Ice, and Slide Wax are daily tools; Ice coins melt on schedule to keep trade flowing | Magic: Ice Magic (Old Flows): frost shaping, deep sight, ice memory, aurora calling; Magic has costs (ice fever) and requires cold meditation; Magic is personal/old; technology is new/communal
Context tick 0 in era The Great Thaw.
Entities to enrich (JSON array expected with id,name,description):
[
  {
    "id": "The Frozen Peace",
    "kind": "era",
    "subtype": "reconstruction",
    "prominence": "forgotten",
    "relationships": {},

    "placeholders": {
      "name": "The Frozen Peace",
      "description": "Rebuilding and consolidation after the wars"
    }
  }
]
CRITICAL: Use each entity's "relationships" field to inform descriptions.
If an NPC has "resident_of": ["Colony X"], mention Colony X in their description.
If they have "member_of": ["Faction Y"], reference the Faction Y faction.
Descriptions must be consistent with actual relationships shown above.

CATALYST AWARENESS: Some entities have agency and trigger events.
If entity.catalyst.eventsTriggered > 5, describe them as influential/impactful.
If entity.catalyst.actionDomains includes specific domains, reflect that in their description.
Action domains: political: governance, alliances, territorial claims; military: warfare, raids, defense, sieges; economic: trade, resource control, blockades; magical: ice magic manipulation, mystical forces; technological: innovation, tool development, weaponization; environmental: natural forces, ice drift, krill migration; cultural: ideology spread, conversion, inspiration; conflict_escalation: war intensification, faction recruitment; disaster_spread: catastrophe expansion, corruption spreading
Use catalyst.influence to determine tone (high influence = respected/feared/powerful).

Tone guidance: Aurora Stack: practical, trade-focused, concise; Nightfall Shelf: poetic, mysterious, innovative
Naming patterns: Two-part names: ice name (birth) + earned name (First Dive deed); Aurora Stack names are shorter and practical; Nightfall Shelf names are more poetic or descriptive
Do not invent new mechanics; stay within canon: Two main colonies with trade and communication; Ice magic exists but has costs; Pre-penguin artifacts are in the berg; Glow-Fissure is recent; Frost Guard neutrality, Deep Singers knowledge.
Keep the existing names unchanged - only enrich descriptions.
IMPORTANT: Keep each description under 50 words. Be concise and evocative.
Return JSON array only.

  "incident": "During The Great Thaw's early expansion phase, Aurora Stack's terraces destabilized when melting ice exposed a pre-penguin artifact chamber beneath the colony's foundation. The discovery coincided with resource scarcity pressures, forcing Aurora Stack to negotiate with neighboring colonies for stabilization materials. The era's uncertainty—magic flourishing but unpredictable, new territories opening but dangerous—made this dependency both necessary and politically fraught.",
  "stakes": "Aurora Stack's survival depends on maintaining trade relationships during The Great Thaw's resource competition. The colony's orderly structure is threatened by both geological instability and the era's chaotic expansion. If the artifact chamber's contents destabilize further or attract unwanted attention, Aurora Stack risks losing its identity as a stable trade hub. The transition into Faction Wars makes old alliances suddenly critical.",
  "publicPerception": "Colonists view Aurora Stack's circumstantial bond with The Great Thaw as inevitable rather than chosen—a colony shaped by forces beyond its control. Some see it as Aurora Stack adapting pragmatically to opportunity (new territories, artifact discoveries). Others view it as the colony being swept into chaos despite its orderly traditions. Cross-colony tensions are rising as The Great Thaw ends, making Aurora Stack's dependency on the era's trade networks appear increasingly vulnerable."

  "incident": "During The Great Thaw's resource crisis, a Deep Singer from the central colonies sought refuge on Nightfall Shelf after discovering forbidden pre-penguin artifacts in Glow-Fissure. The ledge's bioluminescent glyphs—ancient markers, not decoration—resonated with the artifacts' magic. A Frost Guard patrol nearly caught them, but the Shelf's shadowed geography provided concealment. The Deep Singer remained through the era's end, teaching the ledge's inhabitants to read the glyphs' warnings about the coming Faction Wars.",
  "stakes": "The Deep Singer's knowledge could shift power balances between colonies, but their presence violates colony isolation norms. The artifacts suggest pre-penguin claims to Aurora Berg itself. If the Faction Wars escalate, Nightfall Shelf's hidden sanctuary becomes either a strategic advantage or a liability—and the Deep Singer's divided loyalties will be tested.",
  "publicPerception": "Officially unacknowledged. Surface-dwellers assume Nightfall Shelf remains a neutral trading post. The Frost Guard suspects something but maintains silence to preserve their own neutrality. Among Deep Singers, whispers suggest the Shelf has become a repository of forbidden truths. Cross-colony relationships are rare enough to invite suspicion; one tied to artifact magic and Glow-Fissure discovery is dangerous knowledge."

  "incident": "During The Great Thaw's early expeditions, a Deep Singer named Kael ventured beneath Nightfall Shelf seeking pre-penguin artifacts and discovered the Glow-Fissure pulsing with an ancient, otherworldly rhythm. The fissure's light seemed to respond to ice magic, warping currents in patterns that revealed new thermal vents rich with krill. Kael returned with fragmentary knowledge of the phenomenon, but the fissure's true nature—and its growing instability—remained mysterious.",
  "stakes": "The Glow-Fissure became a focal point as The Great Thaw progressed: a resource beacon drawing both colonies' hunters, a magical anomaly that destabilized ice shelves, and a symbol of the era's uncertainty. When The Faction Wars began, control of the fissure's approaches became strategically vital. Deep Singers who studied it risked losing colony allegiance entirely; Frost Guard scouts monitored it to prevent either colony from monopolizing its power. The fissure's warping effects on currents and magic suggested something older than the colonies themselves was awakening.",
  "publicPerception": "The Glow-Fissure transformed from curiosity to omen. Mainstream colonies viewed it with cautious hope during The Great Thaw—a sign of abundance and discovery. But as The Faction Wars loomed, fear replaced wonder. Rumors spread that the fissure was a weapon, a curse, or a doorway. Deep Singers spoke of it in hushed tones as a place where colony identity dissolved. The Frost Guard's careful neutrality around the site only deepened suspicion that something profound and dangerous lay beneath Nightfall Shelf."
