# World-Gen Architecture Improvement Progress Log

## Session Start: 2025-11-24 04:01 MST

### Entry 1 - 04:01 MST
**Phase**: Phase 1 - Discovery and Planning
**Current Activity**: Initial repository analysis

**Files Analyzed**:
- ARCHITECTURE.md (375 lines) - Core design philosophy documented
- package.json - Missing test dependencies (vitest)
- Source structure: 96 TypeScript files across framework and domain layers

**Key Findings**:
- NO test files currently exist (0 tests found)
- Test coverage: 0%
- Clean framework/domain separation already in place
- Vitest not configured in package.json (needs to be added)

**Next Steps**:
1. Create TEST_COVERAGE.md ✓
2. Create REFACTORING_TODO.md
3. Add vitest dependencies
4. Begin comprehensive testing phase
